Never all the other companies that are embedded in some way directly with these 3 or in a supporting role.  Contributes to the (correct) narrative of big tech dominance and control of the entire space.

In addition to everything we all regularly talk about, there's the below two as well:

$BB is now carbon neutral, or even a carbon sink.  Whether a person thinks this is useless or not, it does matter to big funds that only invest in 'sustainable' companies.  So this is good news to increase institutional ownership. This has yet to be monitized through increased fund holdings.

$BB will at some point be upgraded.  Rightly or wrongly (read: wrongly), the dummies at RBC still have their price targets erroneously low for a growing tech company.  Yes, yes, $BB has been around forever and some may argue it's more a blue chip, but now after $BB's turnaround, it's more of  a well-known tech startup at an advanced market integration phase.  Any other tech company with a different name with the degree of future earnings potential would be 5x or 10x market cap.  Funds are likely to increase their holdings more once analysts finally upgrade the share price.  At $7.50 RBC is telling the market that $BB is a current sell and is 20% overvalued.  Based on last earnings, even though almost all metrics were a beat, RBC reiterates $7.50.  Unbelievable.

I’ve watched every panel about the future of IVY from BB Execs, and they are purposefully being vague about everything. One thing I liked a lot though was that after they announced their plan for IVY, they mentioned there was a significant number of OEM’s showed a ton of interest with one OEM asking for a workshop on how IVY is planned, prior to xmas 2020.

Considering how they dominate their market in 19/25 of the major EV producers, I think IVY could be MASSIVE. Obviously nothing is set in stone, but I really think there’s some deep fuckin value here.

Not really. They offer a prebuilt eval/dev ISO even. See [here](http://www.qnx.com/products/evaluation/eval-target.html).

It will run. We have an ATM platform that runs on QNX 4 that the vendor is really pushing to virtualize, even with passthrough to QNX of some hardware encryption cards.

I don't know of any competitors for Jarvis's ability to create a Software bill of materials (SBOM), or their possible Total Addressable Market (TAM).

My understanding is that Jarvis will compile this for you, but most generate their own manually.

The amount of validation, verification, documentation, auditing, and sheer red tape it takes to make a small incremental change to a pre-existing safety-design (hardware or software) is MASSIVE.

ISO 26262 is the THE longest ISO standard in existence. We budget 50-100% more Engineering labor costs for FuSa programs. 


Any software or hardware company that has an ISO26262 certified product, especially ASIL C or ASIL D, is leaps ahead of the competition. It really is a moat. And companies that understand this standard and how to navigate it can innovate much quicker.

The whole industry is bogged down by FuSa; there’s a shortage of FuSa engineers and many companies dont understand how to manage it on top of their existing Quality Management System processes (ISO 9001 etc)

The standard is relatively young, 2011 and the latest version is 2018.

Fuck ISO 26262 but I almost strictly invest in companies that have proven they can churn out qualified products

Bigger edit: the people that wrote ISO 26262 are the exact people that want Tesla to fail.

1. If they are already in all these cars then how do they expand market share?
2. How do they expand profitability if they can't expand market share? Are automakers going to agree to ever higher costs for software. Won't competition here keep prices down?
3. Seems like people are running to all these shorted stocks. The thing is BB does not seem that heavily shorted. There are 555M shares float and 40M shares shorted at 12/31/2020. Institutions and insiders own 51% of float so no reason to assume much potential for a squeeze (definitely nothing like GME).

My take, people are getting excited by this stuff and it may run a bit, but sooner or later without positive news backing the run up, the stock falls. The last time this stock was this high was back  in 2013.

The most vulnerabilities will be found in the most popular systems: Windows has had a butt-load, while Macintosh OSes have had significantly less.

To your  'Engineering students spin up basic RTOSs in half-semester courses', I can only say that anyone who is learning programming can spin up OS in a day. Just go to YouTube and search for 'building operating system' and you will find really detailed courses. Well, still, why have we not seen serious competitors of the three in the markets today: Mac ios, windows, and Linux? Go figure. 

I am not saying BB's RTOS are a monopoly, but given their first mover advantage, they sure have competitive edge over other players. Let's accept: you and I (unless you work inside the core BB team, in which case you would not be coming here, my guess) do not know what goes into the BB's software, just like we do not know what goes into windows or mac blackbox (Linux is a different breed altogether). 

I am a newbie programmer and have been trying to learn as much as I can about computer science/ computer engineering, and AI and I have come to a tentative conclusion that the only ones in a serious position to create competitive RTOS are the MSFT or APPL. Maybe they are working on their own systems, but I have also read that MSFT is collaborating with BB on a bunch of fields. So it is a complex and evolving field.

The way I see it, two things are happening:

1, BB is/already has partnering/partnered with several large and successful companies over cybersecurity and EV stuff. This promises somewhat large, somewhat stable growth in the future as those companies grow as large companies do- obvs BB won't grow as much, but it's at least along for the ride.

2, the current massive fucking rocket is *mostly* BB stock adjusting to what it should be very rapidly. Not too much has fundamentally changed about BB, but considering that it's been doing all this shit for years and then opened the year at a price of 6.58? You best believe this shits undervalued. This has likely created a bubble dude to momentum, but the bubble is still going to pop at significantly higher than it's original price.

My prediction? Short term rocketing, bubble pops to a still high-ish value, then slowly grows. Fuckit I'll put random guess values in this: peaks at 25, pops and hits 15, grows to 20 by EOY.

Two points I think you're mistaken though.

First is BB ivy

>My guess is that AWS just needs a partner to figure out a good way to design some good APIs for car data. BlackBerry will be useful to AWS for a few years and then discarded. 

AWS definitely does not need an old dog like BB to figure out good apis for car data and almost never just ""tries out services"" to see if they stick like Alphabet does. 
The fact that AWS has partnered up with them almost guarantees BB a good long term outlook and exposure to many smaller EV players who would otherwise have a harder time implementing this. 

Second is your view on talent. 

The Rockstar developers who can write Facebook in an evening while drunk is a myth. The idea that a company should have mostly young talent is a silicon Valley meme. Of course the rockstars exist, but most of the best software is built by seasoned devs who have gone through different large projects. This is even more relevant for embedded systems and OS software like BB. The fact that their devs are older is a good thing.

This is the real deal. QNX is also used in industrial DCS (distributed control systems) for power plants, water supply and so on.

However, QNX also competes with ThreadX, VRTX, FreeRTOS, and a bunch of others. You can look towards recent RTOS acquisitions:

* Microsoft acquired ThreadX
* Amazon acquired FreeRTOS

My hunch is, BB will get acquired by a SW company. But who? FB pissed them off, so that leaves Google and Apple. It's also possible that FB does a hostile takeover. Google could be a good suitor whereas Apple has enough smart folks to create their own RTOS.

Or, maybe Microsoft will want to own a majority of the RTOS space and acquires BB... just my $0.02.",2,0,0,False,2021-01-25 00:44:49,shantired,/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l3vs7e/bb_bear_dd_the_case_against_qnx/gknluby/

> I know nothing about this.

TLDR: BB has access to a huge pool of tech talent because of being located 3 min walk to University of Waterloo that produces FAANG quality tech talent faster than Fed prints money.


BB HQ is less than a 3 min walk from University or Waterloo in Canada. They have a long history of attracting and hiring talent from UWs computer science and software eng departments.

For context, Waterloo is a target school for FAANGM who hire Comp Sci and Math grads (retards?) in the hundreds every year.

Once Bill Gates came to campus (this is in mid to late 2000s) and said: “The only place you find more Waterloo jackets than Waterloo itself is in Microsoft”

I don't think this will happen anytime soon, but I could be grossly wrong. My opinion is Amazon won't buy BB for fears that the government will break-up Amazon, but if Amazon is broken-up anyways, then the AWS branch will probably buy BB.

It's all about the data. Now that AWS is involved, the collection of automotive data just got a big upgrade for real-time analysis on a vehicle. It is really cool, but be warned I'm an engineer with a masters in business analytics.

Now let's look a little into how the data and services will send BB into space. Many of the companies that have BB's system in their vehicles will have the maintenance/service shops tied into AWS. Each time a vehicle enters the shop, a report - for a fee or subscription fee - will be created with information on how the vehicle's shitty driver. The vehicle is repair and offers more precise time lines on ware-and-tear and future maintenance. Carfax or a new competitor will now be able to receive more information on used vehicles that has BB systems in them for a price. Also car insurance, no need for ""snapshot"" from Progressive. I dont know what the actual game plan or alternate plans are but AWS and BB look like they are about to show up in boots and ruin the black tie affair.

Honestly, the possibilities are mind-blowing as to what AWS and BB can/will accomplish with this partnership. I bought BB, after reading what exactly was causing the stir and excitement.

The points you're trying to make, make no sense in the context of OP.

> One wrong bit flip in a RTOS running critical functions in a car, and people fucking die. 

This is a meaningless statement without further context. There is nothing about bit flips, critical functions, or *people fucking dying* that is in any way unique to RTOS. This isn't even relevant to OP's point, which is that RTOS systems are commonplace and used in lots of industries and products, and that there's nothing magical about ALMIGHTY RTOS that gives BB some sort of unique advantage because every single other automaker also uses an RTOS in some form or fashion. 

> RTOS systems are so finicky on the low level, the probability of space neutrinos striking a transistor gate and flipping a bit have to be considered in error mitigation. 

Mitigating errors due to bit-flipping also requires hardening of the hardware itself. There's a reason you can't just download an ""ECC Memory"" app and viola, your standard memory is now ECC memory! There's absolutely fuck-all that *any* software you run can do about a latchup that fries a critical IC due to space neutrinos. Even if there was, see paragraph 1. Nothing about RTOS IS FINICKY PEOPLE FUCKING DYING NEUTRINOS implies any kind of particular advantage to BB. 

You realize that there are *hundreds* of ICs running firmware in modern cars and that  many of them are safety critical? Your brakes, your engine, your airbags, your ABS, even your steering wheel ALL depend on robust software/hardware. This isn't a new or unique problem.

It's really spin to say it was any kind of negative.

Taking a look at Rai's Form 3 filing and you will see he will receive roughly 90,000 shares in restricted share units over the next 3 years, to be issued each December.  

In December 2020 he received his first 32,000 share tranche. Yes, he sold them in January, but that to me means nothing because, he only had the shares for a month, and has over 60,000 coming to him over the next few years.  Yes he could have held them, but that's hardly a news story or a sign of weakness.

The joint solution combines BlackBerrry QNX's POSIX-compliant, security-certified real-time operating system and hypervisor with ETAS expertise around functional security and basic software based on the AUTOSAR Adaptive standard. It provides a powerful and secure foundation for the development of microprocessor-based vehicle computers and domain controllers. The solution complies with the ISO 26262:2018 standard, which allows it to be used in systems up to and including ASIL-D. The ETAS and BlackBerry QNX collaboration also aims to help customers work with the integrated solution.

Ever since IVY was temporarily put on the back burner I've wondered how the revenue split on IVY was being handled. 
I don't think AWS has a claim to Cabin development and any subsequent revenue. However, if IVY is incorporated as an optional module with in Cabin, there must be a pricing model. 
The only way I can see the accounting for this working is AWS buying out IVY and using it to be their portal into AWS cloud infrastructure.  
Blackberry and Microsoft could develop their own cloud portal into azure and integrate that into Cabin.

Each cloud provider sharing a subscription model with Blackberry taking a cut of traffic passing through the respective portals.

Nobody is selling a car with an old school radio and then adding QNX sound later OTA, sorry.

Ivy as a stand-alone service made little sense.
QNX is going into 24/25 OEMs cars and not having Ivy / sound built in is nuts….QNX is the vehicle providing access to the customer base.  No need for Ivy to be sold separately.  Qnx is sticky.  Utilize that stickiness.

Edge AI (Ivy) isn’t being developed in AWS at all. 
That’s not how it works.  AWS and now MSFT  are providing (1) the development interface and (2) an option for cloud connectivity.

The AI happens at the edge and is tied to every “app” that’s on-board the vehicle, like CarIQ.

I would likely make a separate post about this. 
The technologies that powered cylance product offerings were used in the making of IVY. 

When you say cylance is an AI-based antivirus. How does that work? What ai powers that? In fact let’s take a step back and ask what you think IVY is?

Cylance was based on like 5 pillars. One of those pillars was user profile identification another was behavioral identification.  
The entire point of IVY was a middleware software so you don’t always have to go from edge to cloud or reduce that movement from edge to cloud to save costs. 

Through behaviorial (they took that pillar from cylance and then trained it to work for automative). They can tell what data to send to the cloud and what to not send to the cloud. You can also establish user behavior, driver behavior(which can be useful for insurance, tires etc). Through profiling( they can establish who is driving the car, establish settings based on this. Maybe is it a different driver?) if you think about it from a cyber security perspective you can see that you can use that to profile how users are using their computers and know when it’s a different user ( you can see the connection now right??). 

So just imagine this and expand this with other ecosystem partners in the automotive space(this will likely expand to other verticals) building different profiles, use cases, positives and false positives and behaviors. Do you see the connection now? 

I can’t find the video anymore but right when IVY was announced there was a deep dive into those pillars and how those pillars are the basis of IVY by  Ryan Permeh. 

Without cylance there never would have been IVY. But with IVY we don’t need the product that is cylance since we already have the technologies that we need.",3,0,0,1738438579.0,2025-02-01 19:27:53,bearclawc,/r/BB_Stock/comments/1if63a3/rumblings_about_cylance_but_more_under_the_hood/mafaz72/

In the antivirus world, you use AI to detect anomalies or malicious activity; in the automotive world, you can adapt that same behavioral modeling to identify driver profiles, habits, or which data should be sent to the cloud.

**However**, that doesn’t necessarily mean IVY is the *same* product or is “built entirely on” Cylance’s code. Rather, BlackBerry has taken the **AI principles** honed in Cylance (e.g., advanced pattern recognition, machine learning pipelines) and **reapplied** them to a different use-case: edge processing and data orchestration for connected vehicles.

In other words, **without Cylance, IVY might not have access to the same proven AI foundation**—but IVY is still its **own automotive-focused platform**, with architecture specifically tailored to QNX-based systems and vehicle sensor data.

I think focusing on very easy support for the Raspberry Pi is a smart idea, the lower friction it is to get started the better. I was on the fence about whether to use QNX on an RPi for a little project I had in mind since I just want to write my code instead of fight with issues stemming from a partially supported OS so the fact that it seems to be a first-class platform is very reassuring.

We heard from the community and our customers that this was a barrier to development with QNX, so our leaders made it a priority to change the paradigm and make it easier for anyone anywhere to get their hands on QNX for their project.  
  
QNX is an embedded operating system, and it excels in those applications. For example, you can find QNX in over 235 million vehicles on the road today. Yesterday we released a Raspberry Pi quick start target image, but it is *not* a desktop-like OS out of the box (though it does have a really cool graphical application launcher the team created that we hope to open-source soon!)  Folks can of course develop a desktop on top of it if that suits their use case. I'd love to see it! But out of the box the Pi is set up as an embedded target ready for embedded app development.

While we can't quite slip this kind of image onto a floppy anymore, the intent is the same: it shouldn't be hard to get a hardware target running QNX for development, prototyping, and learning. Pi is today's equivalent of the floppy demo -- flash the SD card and boot it up!

We're thinking of dev kits for hobbyists, but to be very honest I'm worried about applying QNX to one single kit when the potential of the OS is so vast and broad. On the developer relations team, we're focused on enabling support for as many available kits and components as possible, so you can choose the hardware you want to tinker with and find sample code and tutorials already written and available. (P.S. send me your kit/component suggestions!)

Perhaps this cannot be done, which is why I am simply asking if it would be possible. For me as a developer if it could be written in yocto which I know as such I would probably be happy to use QNX. If I have to learn to build from scratch then I have mixed feelings,

Apparently there have been similar attempts (as i check the internet), however I do not know the reasons why they failed

There would be no need for doing an IPO, and it would be clear to people that BlackBerry is now QNX, they may even change their stock symbol from BB to QNX if they are smart about it and do a direct stock equivalency conversation that kicks it out of the sub five dollar range.

Like seriously if they sell those two (QNX and Ivy) or spin them off or do a stock split I’m dumping BB and going all QNX in a heartbeat.

That is their value, to sell those off… they have no idea what they have or what they are doing. I just have to believe that’s not what’s happening.

BB QNX is a production ready OS that you can license from BB. The data from the OS is stored in Blackberry IVS which is a AWS solution. So there will be charges around using the data as well. It does provide Total control & ownership of data.

AVL on the other hand does a lot of things. But in this context they are a software company that develops tools. So they are like Microsoft and they develop editors and software frameworks. One such framework in IODP that can be used by developers to build their own OS. A third party integration with BB might still be possible but doesn't make sense if you can develop your own OS.

QNX is the OS layer, which would mean that's the car's operating system and potentially mobile app could be built in this environment to ensure that it's hyper secure.

AVL seems to provide a range of solutions: ""We offer a comprehensive portfolio, ranging from system design, testing, calibration and validation services, tailored software and controls development, to tools and methods for scenario-based development and testing. With our constantly evolving partner ecosystem in the areas of test methods, content and technology, we create solutions help you make your ADAS and AD visions a reality."" A big part of building this functionality is collecting real world testing data and we obviously have a very limited set of this, so I would guess that they are providing data, processes, and other tools to actually help build out this ADAS functionality, which we would then build into the car's OS/mobile app/infotainment system.

The last piece is sort of unrelated. Apple and Android have carplay and android auto respectively and that's effectively an app that sits on top of traditional infotainment systems (turns your car screen into your phone). Blackberry doesn't really factor in here since they don't even have a phone OS anymore. The Canoo app on iOS and Android, would be fully integrated, but carplay/android auto if offered would not be fully integrated just sitting on the front end of the tech stack.",2,0,0,False,2021-10-08 23:31:52,OE4000,/r/canoo/comments/q3xzv6/canoo_avl_partnership_and_what_it_means_from/hfx0r2o/

This is different from building apps. This is done to create a broad market appeal and promote future technological use cases. Even without this, in the general embedded market BlackBerry still has a strong position not to mention automotive. 

Starting the phone was different. Of the things that we lack at the time, was positive brand awareness from the customers. In this case, we don’t really appeal to the every day customers. Most of our products is geared towards corporations, and they seem to like BlackBerry. 

The appeal is you never know the next big thing, and also creating market conditions that right from college future employees are already familiar with the technology.",1,0,0,1740955783.0,2025-03-02 21:54:07,bearclawc,/r/BB_Stock/comments/1j1i2at/article_from_south_korea_qnx_leaps_forward_as_a/mfoe9sv/

RIM bought QNX which was used in car infotainment system, with the intent to use it in phone. But it failed.  QNX could not attract App developers one of the reasons for moving away from phone. QNX had to move away from infotainment as Apple's car play and Android took over that business. QNX (Credit to John Walsh) moved to Hypervisor, operating safety critical controls where QNX established itself as (only) Real Time operating & Secured Software.

  Credit to John Walsh again he made QNX everywhere available free (Non Commercial use) and updated to 8.0 platform close to Linux in performance with unparalleled security.  This is to inspire and speed up App development for cars.

THE POINT I am making here is if QNX development goes ahead as plan for cars and is successful, it is possible to revive back Blackberry phone using QNX again as the same App developers will be motivated to develop app for FUTURE phone.

I mean sure, QNX has always been an IoT play. So if phones fit into that context then yeah also as we move into the AI world with embedded systems maybe there’s a play in that for QNX and maybe thinking of phones in the line of edge computes or robots sure. 

I think there’s alot of room for general embedded, since with are mostly software focused it’s just better. If another company wants to take QNX and build an OS  platform ontop of that then yes I think that’s a good plan. Phones have too much overhead cost and then it takes awhile to ramp up and get rewards. It’s just a long term profit game. Why take that risk when the current verticals can ripe rewards based on their current technology stacks and R&D.

This is probably why they can run Tesla Arcade in their infotainment system (it's very likely they plan to run the Linux ports of Witcher 3).

“Blackberry’s QNX technology has built in concepts for hardware and software trust validation, hypervisor to maintain a separation between the safety critical and infotainment systems,  and a core operating system which passes all the functional safety standards,” said John Wall, Sr. VP  SVP, Head of QNX at Blackberry.

""With modern over-the-air updates one can turn a fleet of cars into an army of adversarial robots.  If you believe this cannot happen,   the story “Hackers Remotely Kill a Jeep on the Highway—With Me in It,” by Andy Greenberg may be eye-opening. Over-the-air updates are the classic double-edged sword. The capability is incredibly useful to update and fix functionality for automobiles in the field. However, with a very small amount of work, one can also cause a great deal of havoc in the field. There are at least three levels of risk which must be managed in order to prevent bad consequences:

Secure Platform: The hardware and software pieces which make up the critical pieces of the over-the-air infrastructure must have well understood and secure supply chains.

Secure Run Time: The operating system which manages the automobile must have secure interfaces and be hardened for cybersecurity issues.

Secure Physical Security: The operating centers of fleets (ex: Tesla TSLA’s software update center) must be secure. One imagines a modern version of the popular AMC series “The Americans” running counterintelligence operations on fleet control centers.

The concepts of secure platforms, run-time systems, and protecting critical assets are well known within the industry. As an example, Blackberry, transformed from a cell phone provider to an enterprise software company,  is a leading supplier of secure operating systems for automobiles.""

>How did they defend anyone? They didn't upgrade solarwinds? Congrats not hard to not patch your servers.

I feel like your statement is unfair towards the entire cybersecurity industry in general. It's a thankless job, you get all the blame when your customers get hacked while nobody thanks you for keeping them safe. There's a lot of technical work that goes into prevention and early detection. If none of Cylance's customers got hacked in the SolarWinds incident, I would consider that a success. Otherwise, how else would you evaluate the effectiveness of a cybersecurity product?

>Also what car would need multiple different OS types?

If you have done the basic dd, you wouldn't have asked this question. Check out this [doc](https://www.genivi.org/multi-os-integration-centralized-vehicle-cockpit) from GENIVI alliance, an automotive industry consortium that includes members from big automotive OEMs(BMW, Honda, Nissan), Tier1s (Bosch, Aptiv), middleware and silicon vendors (Qt, Renesas, Nvidia, NXP). 

>I'm also not really sure how Cylance is going to work in a car with limited amount of computing and ram..

In case you don't know, automotive SoCs (System on a Chip)  are getting a whole lot more powerful. Nvidia just [partnered](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300614/mercedes-benz-nvidia-computer-orin-self-driving-adas-ota) with Mercedes recently to put its DRIVE AGX [Orin](https://developer.nvidia.com/drive/faq) (which also uses QNX as the RTOS) in future Mercedes models starting in 2024.

1i0xf9p,QNX Image (IFS) Build tutorials - Raspberry Pi4 specific,https://www.reddit.com/r/QNX/comments/1i0xf9p/qnx_image_ifs_build_tutorials_raspberry_pi4/,16,1.0,4,QNX,True,False,m7ll4hn,t3_1i0xf9p,"I discovered today that QNX 8.0.2 was released about a month ago (mid December 2024). As a result of this I decided to install it and check that everything still built for me (both IFS images and programs). They do...

I ended up downloading a new Quick Start RPi4 image. I was able to get this onto a suitable SD card and running without any major dramas. However, it prompted me to revisit a document I wrote and posted here on Reddit a while back explaining how I configured the Quick Start system to use a static IP address as well as make the terminal environment a bit more comfortable for me.

The Reddit post didn't work out too well - it removed all my text formatting resulting it becoming very hard to read and make sense of. Today I have reproduced it and placed it on my website along with the others that I have written. Using the same \[somewhat hard to decode\] URL format it can be found as:

[https://wwwdotrttsdotcomdotauslashqnxslashrpi4.quickstartdotphp](https://wwwdotrttsdotcomdotauslashqnxslashrpi4.quickstartdotphp)

(change the ""dot"" to . and ""slash"" to / )!

I also discovered that the uname utility doesn't reflect the change in release. It was still showing 8.0.0. As I don't know how to set this any other way, I now add the following command to the build startup-script just after where it calls ""pipe"":

setconf \_CS\_RELEASE 8.0.2

This means that the IFS Welcome message shows the correct release, as does uname if invoked later. The same command can be used in the rc.local file that I describe in the quick start document (see above).

IVY is such a wonderful idea and just makes so much sense and should save 100's of Billions - but it's something that takes time to implement in the product and more importantly in the mindset of the companies.  There are a lot of people who's roles become redundant and a lot of people probably feel threatened by IVY, even the CIO  doesn't want to lose 30pct of their headcount.  

Personally I feel companies have implemented IVY and BlackBerry has cut some sort of deal that is keeping the news out of the headlines.  It could be the companies have the product for free for a period of time or it could be the companies want it for themselves for a specific time period - but from a technology and common business sense standpoint IVY should succeed.",4,0,0,False,2024-08-03 17:26:24,RETIREDANDGOOD,/r/BB_Stock/comments/1ej7fjt/its_easy_to_feel_down_with_the_market_tanking/lgbsu6w/

Again, it's ambiguous. Is he saying that there currently exists an open field with a dozen platforms not even competing, but trying to develop? Or is it now maybe 4,, some half entrenched, and he hoping that the other small players (similar to like what happened with Android for the phone at the later stages where smaller players had to adopt android) will see the light? Hopefully it's more the latter, but his comments don't exclude the possibility that it's closer to a 2009 situation where Android is literally new out of the box and one of many. Or is it 2013 where the last holdouts are finally adopting it for a common standard for phones and there are obvious winners.  

Obviously I hope BB is, but it's not yet obvious to me that that's the case, and I think the phone software OS battles provide an excellent analogy.  

Kind of Ironic, that the last big hold out to not adopt a common phone OS is the one trying to tell them that it's the smartest path forward for everyone. Or maybe it's an easier sell that way.

1. Your call to procmgr\_ability() is moot. The call cannot be used to gain abilities your process doesn't already have.

2. Calling WFI doesn't really give you anything in terms of low power mode that letting the core idle doesn't do. You need some PSCI command to get a core into a low power state.

3. Going into a low power state is much more complicated than just making such a command. You need to ensure that the scheduler knows that the core is now not participating in scheduling, drain IPIs, and delegate the handling of timers queued for this core to another core.

Like clockwork, each June over the last 9 years or so BB released QNX numbers. This year they didn't. Instead, they only released to one job ad. Does that sound logical or reasonable? 

Or, it's a typo. Where does the balance of probabilities lay? 

This reminds me of a year ago when some were clamoring that TD increased it's PT to $14 or something because the range of PT's on yahoo increased from $5 to $14 or whatever. Never mind absolutely none of the press releases or usual fanfare that come with massive price target changes from either BB or TD. Never mind that it was only reflected on 1 lone site. Take it 100% at face value, and all the inconsistencies don't matter - because it's news I want to hear. Naturally nothing came of it, the typo was corrected, and life went on. 

You can't completely suspend critical analysis just because you like what you're seeing. 

Second, 10m/yr is a garbage number. Last year was 20, like 5 years ago I think was 35m. Much live revenues, the real number needs to be looked at on a ""PER YEAR"" basis. The fact BB made $40b in the past, has little relation to the fact it's at $650m this year, down from $870m last year (or whatever). ""Total dollar revenues increases from $40.0b to $40.2b in Q1!"" Not wrong. But useless. 

So from 30m/yr, to 10m/yr this year. What's going on? Fewer installs? More cars being retired? Regardless, it's concerning, since it could be 5m/yr next year, and then forever stable that 250m number. 

Windows 95 is also in a stable number of computers. 

No one's been able to tell me the value of these installs from 10 years ago. 

On one hand, people are saying the industry is finally catching up to BB. QNX 8.0 and auto makers finally have the hardware to make use of the opportunities BB affords. If that's the case, then what's the worth of these old installs on old hardware? So what is it? IVY and QNX will take off once Thor chips and 5g are common place?

""All three systems will be powered by the STLA Brain architecture, which is a cloud-integrated system that accesses all of a vehicle's sensors and actuators. Running on Qualcomm chips, it cuts in half the number of electronic control units (ECUs) needed for each vehicle. It will also be capable of over-the-air (OTA) updates and even speed up development time by 75 percent.""

Cloud Integrated / All sensors - IVY  
Qualcomm- Uses QNX OS  
Half the ECUs - QNX Hypervisor  
OTA Updates - QNX/IVY  
Reduce development time by 75% - IVY

I also reread the presser from Jan when the showed off the virtual cockpit at CES:

[https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2024/stellantis-blackberry-qnx-and-aws-launch-virtual-cockpit-transforming-in-vehicle-software-engineering](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2024/stellantis-blackberry-qnx-and-aws-launch-virtual-cockpit-transforming-in-vehicle-software-engineering)

""Software is a key building block for Stellantis to deliver clean, safe and affordable mobility, as outlined in the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan, and the driving force behind the AI-powered STLA Brain, STLA SmartCockpit and STLA AutoDrive technology platforms. In 2022, [Stellantis selected AWS](https://www.stellantis.com/en/news/press-releases/2022/january/amazon-stellantis-collaborate-on-software-solutions) as its preferred cloud provider for vehicle platforms and the companies began work on the Stellantis’ purpose-built, in-house VEW.

Taking a software-driven approach and deploying the QNX Hypervisor in the cloud, Stellantis can accelerate customer feedback sessions, and with minimal effort, replicate the cockpit experience of a particular brand and vehicle, and make changes in real time to optimize the experience for the driver. This real-time feedback, underpinned by low-latency access to the cloud, allows Stellantis to solicit valuable feedback from its customer and developer base to build future infotainment features and applications.""

So taken together, especially with the mention of AWS/QNX/Hypervisor, it seems like that was the direction they were heading in Jan, they had a prototype to show off, and 6 months later they ironed out the kinks, and now we're here. 

I guess it's possible they scrapped it a week after and developed everything new from scratch, but I really can't see it.",5,0,0,False,2024-06-23 22:25:44,Trilobyte83,/r/BB_Stock/comments/1dmi5b3/massive_wakeup_call_from_stellantis_to_every/l9yu9e5/

There is no need to mention it, because no one cares, it doesn't add anything to STLA's offering except making it cheaper/better for them, and anyone else can do the same by signing up. The customer doesn't care anything beyond if it works.

Similar to another industry I know, bikes. Most people don't realize, but most bikes come out of the same couple monster shops in China. Companies buy them, brand them, attach 3rd party components and sell them. You make your specs for a material, design, quality, and those companies will do it cheaper than anyone else can. 

Merely cutting and welding tubes into a design, particularly at volume, is a fairly pedestrian, boring activity. No one cares who does it, at long as it's done and meets spec. And it just so happens that these handful of companies are able to do it better and cheaper than anyone else, so everyone uses them for a mutual benefit. 

Now that cheap welding and boring manufacturing is taken care of, the companies can sell what customers \*really\* care about. Design, specs, features. \*How\* exactly it went from design phase to finished product, and if they did it cheaply in China, or some guy in Denver in his basement, I couldn't care less about as long as it meets specs, and at a competitive price. 

That's BB. No one cares \*how\* the data gets processed, or distilled down at the edge, be it BB, or maybe STLA did their own things, or if it's a million monkeys at a million switchboards, again so long as it works. 

I believe BB has the best offering, and hopefully that's what's allowed STLA to leap frog some of the other cos since they're wasting time going it alone - that's the optimistic take. 

But for them to have leapfrogged even Tesla to level 3, I find it hard to believe they did it on their own coming so late to the game, so I'm cautiously optimistic that it is due in large part to the help BB provided, and all other companies must see the light or get left behind.",7,0,0,False,2024-06-23 18:31:06,Trilobyte83,/r/BB_Stock/comments/1dmi5b3/massive_wakeup_call_from_stellantis_to_every/l9xrel1/

**ME:**  *""140% YoY backlog growth CY2022…1H CY2023 ahead of 2022!""*  
  
**JC:**  Q2 CC at Sept 2023: *""In fact, by the end of the first half, we have secured more than two thirds of our FY24 annual target for new backlog and expect to exceed it. In the quarter QNX secured 20 new design wins in Auto, and 7 in General Embedded Market verticals. ""*  
  
So where will the backlog be at end for Q4 2024 ? The backlog went from $560M (FY 2022) to $640M (FY 2023) to ? **At minimum, if calculated at 140% YoY...$895M**.  
  
Any business that has a backlog of such as BB should have a higher multiple. There are a lot of vulture funds, private equity and competitors that want to keep the price down and all their shenanigans and to acquire shares cheaply from retail by creating FUD.  
  
Blackberry has never been in a stronger position now than three years ago when IVY was first introduced. IVY is being adopted.  
  
In fact BB paid down $215M in Q3 of the debentures.  
  
That is why Prem Watsa invested in a new debenture to backstop the nonsence of the bears on Wall Street.

Who cares about giving back money you borrowed and never touched? Borrow $100k off a credit card, let it sit for a month, pay it back, and call it an accomplishment? Please. Not the same as someone who ran up 100k in CC debt for gambling then paid it off by scrimping and consuming way less than they earned. 

This wasn't some hard done company that was up to their tits in debt that they dug themselves out of. 

The opposite actually. They had a \*ton\* of cash, and quarter after quarter whittle it away. They just didn't happen to need so much that they needed to touch the debt. The direction (net cash burn) is still 100% wrong. The fact that it wasn't so, so bad that they needed to go to the borrowed cash in the sock drawer, and they were able to return it unused is not something to be celebrated.

It wasn't being held back by anything other than their longstanding failure to actually make any money year after year after year after year. There is no short squeeze or institutional manipulation on BB. In reality, the actual ""manipulation"" has been the pump and dump(s) driven by WSB.

The vast majority of BB ""DD"" on WSB has been basically garbage by people who didn't even know what the fuck BB was themselves until this last year.

Nobody actually gives a shit about ""design wins"" if it doesn't actually make you any money other than morons trying to rally other morons.

BB is a long term hold (2+ years out). The 2 big swings this year have purely been WSB driven that HFs jumped on to pump and dump and left people who bought at 19 bag holding because they didn't know what the hell was going on in the first place.

Did you even read the article I linked? No. Clearly not. It’s literally there, but you’re not actually listening. Yeah they’re still using QNX for a different feature, but not for Infotainment anymore, which is still a cancelation of another deal. There are always multiple deals for different things and this was still a dropping of one of them. It ends up affecting the potential Net revenue negatively.

By the way, I actually gave up on you having any sense of logic long ago. I’ve been posting in attempt to show other people that going off the deep end like this is illogical and dumb.

BB does have a growing future again, but trying to shoehorn it in with the other meme shit is ridiculous. It is a good long term play, but there is no baseless rocket. There is no squeeze. It will grow as it is meant to.

I am 100% sure you had no idea what BB even was 4 months ago. BB was recruiting me and my friends in the early 2000s.

I did this by running these lines before creating the virtual target.

After that I can log onto the qnx virtual machine with ssh by using the ip address on the **virbr0** adapter which is

At the time, until we fixed it by other means, the way I got around it was to make up a USB drive with everything I wanted on it, shove it in a USB slot, and add to the IFS build file the following:

waitfor /dev/umass0t177

mount -t qnx6 -o sync=none /dev/umass0t177 /

This effectively overlayed the USB drive on top of the IFS.

That got us out of quite a hole. But turned out to be unreliable - the USB drives got quite hot due to the ambient temperatures they were being used it while we were conducting our R&D, and after a while they failed. This was not a QNX problem - just poor quality USB thumbdrives! It's not something I'd apply to a production system that I wanted someone to pay for! :-)

What I just discovered is that my USB thumbdrive is automatically mounted as /fs/usb0

I didn't have to perform an explicit mount at all! And it explains why I kept getting the ""Resource Busy"" error message when I tried.

This is how my QNX6.5 systems do it on the x86 platforms (going back 10 years). I didn't need  to apply this to my QNX7.1 targets (x86\_64, RPi's and various Xilinx MPSoC's).

Anyway, I  ""unmounted""  it (umount /fs/usb0) and then tried the manual mounts again as follows:

mount -t qnx6 -o sync=none /dev/umass0t177 /data/usb\_qnx6   (worked!)  
mount -t qnx6 -o sync=none /dev/umass0t177 /usb\_qnx6   (also worked!)

The 2nd one indicates to me that / is not locked.

What doesn't work is:

mount -t qnx6 /dev/umass0t177 /usb\_qnx6   (due to the missing -o sync=none)

So the upshot of this is that if you want to mount your USB drive as something other than /fs/usb0 you have to unmount that first. Then it's happy days!

I've gone into the registry, disabled device guard, disabled hypervisor via BCDEDIT along with memory integrity and every other security feature and still not been able to disabled VBS. I disabled Virtual Machine Platform, Hyper-V, Sandbox too.

Secure Core is a hardware+software integration that enforces security mechanisms within the OS. It's a good feature for fleet managed PCs but doesn't belong in the consumer arena. It's Appleyfing the Windows ecosystem.

The solution, after several weeks of experimenting and giving up, was to disable Secure Boot (and Bitlocker before disabling Secure Boot or the OS wouldn't load). Then go in and disable all the security features and hypervisor functionality again. One laptop was a pain (Dell G16 7630) but the HP x360 was the most annoying by far with its Secure Core bullshit. 

Now VMWare Workstation runs beautifully - benchmarks at near native speeds (Raptor Lake CPU) in VMs and allows or nested virtualization without using Hyper-v's crappy hypervisor (for desktop use it sucks - no 3d acceleration, no nested virtualization, lower compatibility with various OS).",2,0,0,False,2024-12-28 19:54:00,Jebusdied04,/r/virtualization/comments/1hnbrbe/intel_vtx_disabled_error_during_qnx_software/m48nc3e/

QNX introduced the new term ‘QNX Cabin,’ with the core focus being on VirtIO. QNX supports VirtIO, allowing easy deployment of guest operating systems that support VirtIO. Since VirtIO is a standard, it can either guide each SoC vendor or directly create the lower layers to support VirtIO. Operating systems like Android and others shown in the diagram can be configured to support VirtIO.

 

One of the demos involved downloading an arm64 qemu image of AGL (Automotive Grade Linux) and running it on AWS Cloud on top of QNX Cabin without modifications. It also demonstrated that the same image could be deployed on Samsung and Qualcomm reference hardware.

 

The biggest concern with VirtIO in product development is performance. QNX addressed this by demonstrating a complex graphics demo running at 60fps. However, real-world products are a different story, and challenges remain to be solved.

 

Additionally, QNX has implemented a server capable of receiving vehicle signal data as part of the Cabin.

 

Another issue is that using QNX Cabin incurs additional licensing costs. While I’m not sure of the exact cost, I suspect it might be expensive since it’s QNX. However, we can start by getting an evaluation to conduct a proof of concept (PoC).

QNX is used for Distribution in the real world - Linux is used for development in labs.

Historically it has been easier to develop under Linux, there are more toolsets, it's free, it's easy and fast and many developers are familiar with it.   When getting things set up and working you don't have to worry about timing as much as you are developing in a controlled environment.  If it crashes or something is late it's not a life threatening situation.  Therefore Linux is an easy way for developers to work with NVIDIA.

However if you want to run your NVIDIA based applications in the real world you have to use QNX as it is the only OS that makes sure things run properly based upon timing and priority that's why it is required by NVIDIA for real world use.

The switch from Linux to QNX as you move to the real world is as I understand it quite painless to the point of a simple recompile in the Nvidia situation.

Is it possible to use a different kernel? Absolutely, but they're usually a derivative of the original one. You can download the kernel used within Android and if you know what you're doing you can hack it to bits and optimize it for different purposes.

Linux and QNX are on the opposite sides of the Operating Systems design philosophy spectrum (if such a thing exists). Linux does everything and the kitchen sink within the kernel (privileged space, very dangerous place to have rogue code). QNX does practically nothing except the most critical low level tasks in the kernel pushing almost all non-critical services into user space where it can be locked down. This might sound trivial, but it's a HUGE distinction in operating system design.

Theoretically speaking, monolithic kernels (like Linux) are better performing/more efficient at completing most non-arbitrary tasks than a microkernels (like QNX). Microkernels are typically slower, but they have much better handle over what's going on and are MUCH easier to secure.

As for why Android M is 3x faster, I have no idea... QNX the OS could be playing a role I really have no idea. But I know that they're not using a QNX kernel within Linux.

There is always a trade-off between monolithic and microkernel architectures and performance vs. safety, although a lot has changed since the original versions of Mach earned microkernels their poor reputation for performance.  Today, I think it depends largely on what drives your performance problems, and whether or not the kernel is really in your way.

Most performance problems on Android come from sloppy code that abuses the Java memory system and puts pressure on it to garbage collect more often.  When you have to pause for GC, it's really hard to get all of your drawing done at frame rate, which is why many Android apps lag.  It also doesn't help that pre-Marshmallow Android runtimes use a garbage collector that doesn't move in-use items, so if you write bad code, you can fragment your heap so badly that your app crashes, which happens.

I think using QNX instead of the Linux kernel isn't as far fetched as it might appear.  I used to port OSes to custom hardware (VxWorks, QNX, etc.), and there were always two sticking points.  First, porting drivers is never easy, but BlackBerry have already been developing their own drivers for QNX, so this isn't really an issue.  Second, we found that no matter how POSIX a customer thought their code was, there would always end up being an edge case where they depended on something very OS-specific (like taskLock in VxWorks).  Since Android runs in either the Dalvik or ART VMs, the interface between the OS and the applications is defined in a clearer and stricter way than in other embedded apps, and since BlackBerry were already running an Android runtime on QNX, it seems like they'd be prepared to take that runtime and use it as the base for making Android more native on QNX than it is in BB10.

It's an interesting idea. I just wonder if it's really what they're doing.  Hopefully we'll know soon.",5,0,0,False,2015-08-31 16:31:17,9vDzLB0vIlHK,/r/blackberry/comments/3j0isr/blackberry_venice_is_running_qnx_kernel/culymbn/

I think most analysts are going to struggle to quantify revenue impact of the new pricing you show here. Its a wait and see game. 

Also as I see it the pricing showcased here merely relates to $ that the growing ecosystem of developers will pay to BB for having cloud based access to QNX. I would imagine that BB is charging something relatively low to encourage developers to embrace QNX and commit to becoming members of QNX ecosystem. The whole point is to build a bigger and bigger ecosystem so that auto and medical device and aerospace companies ultimately embed QNX into everything they do with
Multiple deployments per car / device. 

In the end BB will continue to make most of its QNX revenues from developer seat and more
Importantly royalties. The AWS developer access pricing  does not change the revenue model or projections for QNX deployment in auto or GEM. The autos and med device companies that have awarded BB with design wins are all locked into a royalty pricing model that is based on deployment per car / device.

At this stage, we know the results are coming as the revenue is already backlogged. However, everything they are are doing is building on the huge amount of design wins that just now need to reach production. 

My point being, that while revenues will continually grow yoy, the future is already being secured by training and development. The engineers and programmers being hired now will be building products and revenues for 5 and 10 years out. 

Given that the vehicles QNX is in now will likely be in production for a decade. New hires will be designing the next generation, which will be in production for another decade.

Organic growth year over year, well into 2040. So for all you bagholders (me included), you will have to ask yourself ""should I sell"" as we slowly climb the ladder out of this hole. We will all be happy to see green at what ever our cost basis is, but Blackberry is not going to stop there and this helps to confirm that!

At the end of the day we are seeing now the first signs of progress on launch of AwS cloud ecosystem. Step 1 is about building adoption. 

Adoption means more people developing cool stuff on QNX. New apps. Enhanced features. Cool Whatever. 

More development on QNX the leads to more design wins as products move into design finalisation stage. Your long list of companies looking for QNX talent are companies that have either already announced a design list or will be added to the customer list soon once the design win is confirmed. 

Design wins equals developer seats which means pre production revenues. 

And then finally we are talking about royalties. 

According to transcripts BB currently hitting revenue per car of low teens.  $11 - $13 per car with some older car models running at high single digits. Maybe some higer tech EV are in mid teens or high teens already. Here is Chen from the last Q call. 

——————————————————
Mike Walkley

Just maybe a follow-up on the IoT question. Just based on some of the record level you're seeing for the design phase of revenue and particularly in ADAS. As these cars go into production in future years, how should investors think about maybe the magnitude of royalty per car versus the current infotainment system today?

John Chen

Yes. So -- yes, that's a good question. So, the ARPU, which is you're asking basically the ARPU questions, our targeted ARPU remains to be $25 a car. And, of course, we’re quite a big business from it. However, if you look at the infotainment world, infotainment world now down to probably $1 to $2 a car. On the other hand, ADAS is probably pushing high-single-digit dollars, $8, $9 -- $7, $8, $9. So, that's how -- and then any newer features, cockpit, clusters, vehicle-to-vehicle communications and stuff, they all have a reasonable dollar amount tied to it, certainly a factor about the infotainment.",5,0,0,1675498334.0,2023-02-04 07:59:40,Disasterdujour888,/r/BB_Stock/comments/10syfjy/the_changing_qnx_revenue_landscape_qnx_in_the/j75tqpq/

A single container application of VR wouldn't necessarily benefit by priority controls in a virtual machine unless there were multiple vm's running on the same processor. This is why QNX and the QNX hypervisor are so critical in the vecilce with many software stacks on a single chip.
