In the game, there are moments when the player steps on a specific tile and a widget appears, offering a choice to either go straight or turn. I'm not sure how to set up this functionality.</p>
<p>I'm a beginner, so if you decide to help, could you please explain the steps or approach you used to implement something similar? I've attached all the relevant screenshots that might help ( <a href=""https://imgur.com/a/CjfgGcm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://imgur.com/a/CjfgGcm</a>). If you need any additional information, please let me know. This project is very important to me, and I really want to complete it.</p>
<p>I tried changing the parameters, but it didn't help. I expected the widget to update accordingly, but nothing changed.</p>

The solution must not rely on any form of HTTP server. The dist bundle must run Cesium maps when double-clicking index.html on any computer. This is because the dist needs to be integrated into ‌Unreal Engine 5 (UE5)‌ for interaction with UE5. However, UE5 can only load index.html that opens directly via double-clicking.</p>

Double-clicking index.html fails due to CORS errors or compatibility issues. Alternatively, if there are UE5 experts, how can an index.html (which cannot run via double-clicking) be deployed within UE5 for interaction?</p>

I currently am working on a game in UE5.5. I have an airship, which has components, things like engines, weapons etc. Structure for the weapons is setup like this:</p>
<p>Airship-&gt;Hardpoint(component)-&gt;Weapon-&gt;Ammo</p>
<p>It's setup like this so that a game designer (aka me) just creates a blueprint airship with X amount of hardpoints, and then the player can custom add whatever weapons to that airship in game.</p>
<p>I have created a main menu where the user can select an airship, and I would like to populate drop-downs for weapon selections for each hardpoint, along with ammo selects for each weapon. Through some iterations I've found that hardpoints are only known to the engine at runtime and were not populating. So I thought to spawn a temp airship in the menu but this means all the airship's code being turned on which causes other issues.</p>
<p>I am looking for some other options to get through this, or around it. I thought about setting a flag or something that stops the physics turning on, or using a stripped down sub-class of the airship to populate the menus but there must be some better ways to solve this.</p>

If there is a better way to convey an mp4 file on stack overflow, please let me know in the comments. The video showcases the animation working relatively well when the player is idle or walking, and looking completely broken when the player is running. If there is a way to disable the blending on the upper-body of the character, I believe the animation would not look so broken. Here is my code for playing the animation below for reference.

<p>I am still getting the same error message.</p>
","<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>I’ve some plugins in my project. And months ago I enabled them under some folder on my disk. I’ve already forgotten those. Probably you’re in the same situation.</p>
<h3>Step 1</h3>
<p>Go to the Plugins directory on your disk. For my current version, this is the directory on my disk:</p>
<pre><code>C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.3\Engine\Plugins\Runtime
</code></pre>
<h3>Step 2</h3>
<p>Find your mysterious plugin there, and open the directory. In my case, it was the HairStrands plugin.</p>
<pre><code>C:\Program Files\Epic Games\UE_5.3\Engine\Plugins\Runtime\HairStrands
</code></pre>
<h3>Step 3</h3>
<p>There is a file with the .uplugin extension, open with your desired editor of choice:</p>
<pre><code>HairStrands.uplugin
</code></pre>
<h3>Step 4</h3>
<p>Find the <strong>EnabledByDefault</strong> word in the document. You’ll probably see it like below:</p>
<pre><code>...
&quot;EnabledByDefault&quot;: false,
...
</code></pre>
<h3>Step 5</h3>
<p>So, we need to enable that setting/s to be able to open our project again.</p>
<pre><code>...
&quot;EnabledByDefault&quot;: true,
...
</code></pre>
<p><strong>👆 Solved!</strong></p>
<p>That solved the problem!</p>
<p><strong>⚠️ You've to <strong>repeat</strong> the process if you've more than one plugin.</strong></p>
<h3>Step 6</h3>
<p>Just re-open your project.</p>
<h2>Version</h2>
<p>This issue is version-independent and exists in both Unreal Engine 4 and 5. Till version 5.3.</p>
<p>Hoping to see a solution in future releases.</p>

79497884,Member functions called in lambdas,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79497884/member-functions-called-in-lambdas,1,1741606860,"c++, pointers, lambda, unreal-engine5","<p>This question arose when programming for Unreal Engine with <code>TFunction&lt;&gt;</code> but it is fundamentally about C++ and I believe the example is equivalent.</p>
<p>The questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>How to ensure that the callback is not called when the object doesn't exist</li>
<li>Is there a significant overhead from this type of member-function-from-lambda call?</li>
<li>Are there some other hidden dangers in this approach?</li>
</ol>
<p>The code:</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;functional&gt;

// Basic class with a callback function expressed as a lambda calling a member function 
class Foo {
    private:
        int i = 0;
    public:
        Foo(int j){
            i = j;
        }

        // A member function that should be called by a manager
        void f(){
            std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        }

        // Wrap the member function in a lambda
        std::function&lt;void()&gt; wrapper = [&amp;](){f();}; // &lt;---- What happens when object is destroyed before call? 
};

// Manager class which calls a specified function after some work 
class Manager {
    public:
        // A function that returns immediately and after some time calls the passed function
        void asyncWork(std::function&lt;void()&gt; callback){
            // Some work here...

            callback();
        } 
};

int main() {

    // Create object
    Foo foo(42);

    // Create manager
    Manager manager;

    // Pass the callback function to the manager
    manager.asyncWork(foo.wrapper);

    return 0; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>The program does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a simple object which has a <code>std::function</code> wrapping for a member function call. This is done in Unreal Engine using the <code>TFunction&lt;&gt;</code> type.</li>
<li>A manager class is passed this wrapped function as a callback</li>
<li>After some time, the callback is triggered but the original object may not exist anymore</li>
</ul>
","<p>To answer specific to Unreal Engine, the solution is to use a <code>TWeakObjectPtr</code>.  This requires the class be derived from <code>UObject</code>.</p>
<p>Assuming that you change <code>Foo</code> to <code>UFoo : public UObject</code> then:</p>
<pre><code>TFunction&lt;void()&gt; UFoo::Wrapper()
{
    TWeakObjectPtr WeakThis (this);
    return [WeakThis]()
    {
        if (ThisClass* This = WeakThis.Get())
        {
            // This is a valid object
            This-&gt;CallPrivateMethod();  // or call This-&gt;f() if you want
        }
        // else the object WeakThis points to has been destroyed
    };
}
</code></pre>
<p>To generalize to C++, presumably the same method would work with a <a href=""https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/weak_ptr"" rel=""noreferrer"">std::weak_ptr</a>.</p>

<p>I try to make an multiplayer game where I want to interact with widget components in an actor that is set to world space that all users can interact with it. The game is in UI mode most of the time and controlled with the mouse</p>
<p>For the game it is important to know who clicked on the mentioned widget to check if it is owned by him or do some other checks.</p>
<p>I tried to use the OnComponentClick for the widget component but you lose the ability to know what the user clicked on the widget. And in my case it is necessary to know that.
Another method is the InteractionComponent that is placed on the player controller, maybe I am  not knowledgably  enough to use it but it didn't help me with this problem.
The last thing I tried is to use the owner(pc) of the widget and compare it with the local player PC but this didn't work too.</p>
<p>My question now, is there any way to retain the interaction of the widget and still check for the owning property of that widget/actor to determine if he is allowed to interact with it.</p>
<p>Any help would be gladly appreciated</p>
<h2>Side note</h2>
<p>I looked up if other game engines have the same issue like unreal and I found that it is possible in Unity to change the default behavior of the clicks to take more arguments. I looked it up for Unreal but I think my abilities aren't sufficient to implement anything like this. But maybe it could be a solution</p>

<p>Ok I tried it and it seems to work. But I need to say this solution is a bit janky if I think about it. I don't know why Unreal isn't improving on their widget handling in general.</p>
<p>For the people reading this after the solution here is how I did it.</p>
<p>I made a reference in the widget for the parent actor. When the button is pressed it triggers a event/function in the parent actor and passes the local character as described here</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GetPlayerCharacter(0) → Will get the local character from the world you are interacting.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This actor has a reference for the owning pawn. These two can be compared and there you go the owning distinction is implemented.</p>

But on Hololens I see a shift when I change my position . i.e the objects seem to follow my location rather than staying put on their current location . Also note that we are not using OpenXR and have hooked onto the UE render pipeline to fetch the frame and pass it to our upstream clients .

To do so I've been working on a custom Unreal Engine actor that will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Scan all of the non-player static meshes in a level.</li>
<li>Detects intersections and creates connections between the vertices of intersecting                   meshes.</li>
<li>Combines all intersecting static meshes into a single static mesh.</li>

79341522,Why does UE5 sometimes not show the skeletal mesh in the blueprint viewport details panel?,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79341522/why-does-ue5-sometimes-not-show-the-skeletal-mesh-in-the-blueprint-viewport-deta,1,1736403222,unreal-engine5,"<p>To Unreal Engine Developers:
I am using the latest stable release of UE 5.5.1, and I am also using a sample project from Epic Games (GameAnimationSample pack). I believe I have noticed this bug in previous versions of UE5 and I would bet others have seen this similar issue. Sometimes the skeletal mesh that you see in the Viewport aren't what the UE5 details panels see, however if you click the button to locate the mesh, it takes you to the folder that has the mesh but it doesn't select the asset being used. It's almost as if the lookup for the ID got lost somewhere.</p>

<p>What I've Tried:
Checking the Convai Plugin Folder:</p>
<p>The plugin's <code>Source/ThirdParty/gRPC/lib/android/</code> directory lacks the required protobuf static libraries (<code>libprotobuf.</code>a, <code>libprotobuf-lite.a</code>, and l<code>ibprotoc.a)</code> for Android architectures like arm64-v8a.
Searching for Precompiled Protobuf Libraries:</p>
<p>I checked the Protobuf GitHub releases, but they only offer precompiled libraries for desktop platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows). Android libraries are not included.</p>
<p><strong>Attempting to Modify platforms.json:</strong></p>
<p>I updated my <code>platforms.json</code> file to include API Level 34, but this didn’t resolve the packaging issue.</p>
<p><strong>Rebuilding Project:</strong></p>
<p>Cleared Intermediate and Saved folders and rebuilt the project multiple times.</p>
<p><strong>Environment Details:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unreal Engine Version: 5.4 <br>Android NDK Version: r26b<br>Target API Level: android-34<br>Convai Plugin Version: Latest (as of November 2024)<br>
Protobuf Version: Need at least v3.21 to match gRPC.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How can I resolve the linker errors and obtain or build the missing protobuf libraries (<code>libprotobuf.a</code>, <code>libprotobuf-lite.a</code>, <code>libprotoc.a</code>) for Android architectures like arm64-v8a? <br>
Could the issue be related to mismatched NDK versions or Protobuf configurations?</p>
<p>Any guidance, detailed steps, or examples would be greatly appreciated!</p>

I've built the library using cmake, which has created a static lib file (utf8proc_static.lib), which I'm referencing in my Build.cs file using PublicAdditionalLibraries.Add. It seems to recognize the lib, since, if I make changes to the path, it immediately complains that it can't find the file, so all seems well on that front. I also included the location of the header file utf8proc.h, using PublicIncludePaths.Add.</p>
<p>In the cpp where I want to use the lib, I'm using #include &lt;utf8proc.h&gt;, and again all seems well, as I can travel to each function's definition over in the utf8proc.c file, using control+lmb. However, when I build the project it tells me there are 5 unresolved externals, and I'm getting 5 LNK2019 errors like this one:</p>

<p>I've been troubleshooting for a while but I can't seem to get to the bottom of it. I'm using other dlls and libs, and I'm not having issues with any other library. I think this is the only static lib I'm using though.</p>
<p>I've tried deleting UE's binaries and intermediate folders and regenerating the visual studio project files. Tried adding the folders containing the.lib and .h files to the VC++ directories via VS22 project settings. Out of desperation I've also tried moving the lib file over to the UE project's Binaries/Win64 folder and I've also tried including one of utf8proc's subfolders, which has a few more h and c files, but nothing.</p>
<p>At my wits' end. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>So far so good this works fine and gets replicated to all clients just fine</p>
<p>Next the UHealthComponents are ActorComponents too, first I tryed it with them as UObject but I got some other problems with that, and I turned on replication and added the variables like Health as UPROPERTY and replicated them too.</p>
<p>After starting the game I initialze the cards and add the newly created HealthComponents to the ShipStats ActorComponent</p>

<pre><code>// Go through all the Health Components and set their content

<p>All whole Initialization part is done on the server and normaly replicated down to the clients.</p>
<p>Now finally to my problem. Player one gets the HealthComponents and the act ingame just like intended but the second player just gets a TArray of nullpointers.</p>
<p>The way I displayed the  ShipStats ingame i can see this in the inspector and after stopping the game I get the &quot;Accessed None&quot; treatment.</p>

<p>It appears that something might have gone wrong with the installation, or this could be a bug with Unreal Engine 5. How to resolve this issue?</p>
","<p>I should have mentioned earlier that I had all SDKs and NDKs installed, as I frequently work on Android development. However, the real solution was Vandit's final suggestion:</p>
<p>“Reinstall Android Support in UE: If the problem persists, consider reinstalling the Android support packages through Unreal Engine’s setup process.”</p>
<p>In summary, the key step is illustrated in the screenshot below.</p>

I want to dynamically configure the Unreal Engine include paths in my CMake setup without hardcoding the engine directory (e.g., /home/user/UnrealEngine5.5). This is to make the project more portable across systems and installations.</p>
<p>What I’ve Tried:</p>
<p>I wrote a FindUnreal.cmake module that hardcodes the paths:</p>
<pre><code>set(UNREAL_INCLUDE_DIRS
   ${UNREAL_ENGINE_DIR}/Engine/Source
   ${UNREAL_ENGINE_DIR}/Engine/Source/Runtime
   ${UNREAL_ENGINE_DIR}/Engine/Source/ThirdParty

)

set(UNREAL_LIBRARY_DIRS
   ${UNREAL_ENGINE_DIR}/Engine/Binaries/Linux
)

file(GLOB UNREAL_LIBRARIES &quot;${UNREAL_LIBRARY_DIRS}/*.so&quot;)
if (NOT UNREAL_LIBRARIES)
   message(FATAL_ERROR &quot;No Unreal Engine libraries found in: ${UNREAL_LIBRARY_DIRS}&quot;)
endif ()
</code></pre>
<p>in the CMakelists.txt</p>
<pre><code>include_directories(
   src/
   ${UNREAL_INCLUDE_DIRS}
)
</code></pre>
<p>While this works, it’s not portable. I’d like to dynamically discover these paths, perhaps using find_path() or environment variables.</p>
<p>I attempted using an environment variable (UE_ENGINE_DIR) to specify the engine root, but I'm unsure how to recursively add all the required include paths.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How can I dynamically discover and configure Unreal Engine include paths in CMake?</li>
<li>Is there a standard or best practice for integrating external projects with Unreal Engine headers and libraries?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional Context:</strong></p>
<p>I’ve verified that Unreal Engine is installed in /home/user/UnrealEngine5.5. The relevant header files (CoreMinimal.h, Containers/Array.h) are located under Engine/Source/Runtime/Core/Public. However, due to missing include paths for dependencies like CoreTypes.h, the build fails unless I manually add these paths to CMakeLists.txt.</p>
<p>Any advice or examples would be greatly appreciated!</p>

Right now I'm having trouble getting it able to walk around sharp bends like in the attached photo.
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/3KWqgefl.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Example Of Problem</a></p>
<p>I'm using a set of line trace by channel to find the normal of the static mesh directly in front of the spider, I multiply that normal by negative one so it points inwards toward the mesh which I set to be the new direction of gravity which allows the spider to stick to ceilings and walls fine.</p>
<p>The main problem is getting it to go around sharp bends. Right now I have it set up so that if the first set of line traces (Red) doesn't connect with anything than a second set (Blue and Yellow) shoots out to detect the ledge in front of the spider. If I use the second set to set the direction of gravity than the spider will go flying back into the sky.</p>
<p>I've tried using the teleport blueprint node to get around corners but it leads causes the movement to feel too jagged and snappy.</p>
<p>I've seen some people set the default movement from walking to flying in the character movement component but I'm not super clear on how to implement it.</p>
<p>Does anybody have an idea as to how I can get it to move around corners seamlessly?
Any guidance or criticism would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Does anyone has a clue on how to solve this?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<ul>
<li>machine cleanup &amp; reinstallation following documentation on unreal and microsoft website</li>
<li>reload configuration from an another computer via &quot;load configuration&quot; in Visual Studio Installer</li>
<li>adding <code>&lt;SuppressTfmSupportBuildWarnings&gt;true&lt;/SuppressTfmSupportBuildWarnings&gt;</code> to UnrealBuildTool.csproj, but it only fixed the first part of the errors</li>

<p>I was able to install and launch the emulator without any issues. But when I run the emulator I get no response from any mouse clicks or keyboard clicks.</p>
<p>I've been digging around trying to find a solution. One common fix I see talks about disabling any proxy servers as that can interfere with the input, but I've gone through my settings and confirmed I don't have a proxy server running anywhere.</p>
<p>I've also seen people having issues with internet connectivity with their emulator and that effecting if inputs are read or not. I don't have an issue with internet connectivity with my emulator.</p>
<p>Past that I'm out of ideas. Hopefully someone can help me figure out why the emulator isn't responding to input.</p>
<p>I've tried rebooting my computer, uninstalling and reinstalling the emulator, I've tried different versions of the emulator. Nothing seems to work in fixing this issue.</p>

<p>I'm running UE5.4 with two player and as net connection I use listen server.</p>
<p>So I'm trying to make a simple Door which you can interact with to open or close it. When you interact with the door the client call a server RPC named <strong>ServerInteract</strong>, this RPC update the bOpen attribute of the door actor. This attribute is marked as ReplicatedUsing so its should be replicated on all the client and also call the OnRep function on all the client. This OnRep function play the opening or closing animation based on bOpen state.
My problem is that when I interact with the door from the client 0 which is also the host/server the replication work perfectly. But when I interact with the client 1 which isn't the host but a simple client the ServerInteract RPC isn't even call even if the owner of the actor has a valid connection.</p>

<pre><code>void APlayerCharacter::Move(const FInputActionValue&amp; Value)
{
    FVector2D InputVector = Value.Get&lt;FVector2D&gt;();

    if (IsValid(Controller))
    {
        //Get Forward Direction
        const FRotator Rotation = Controller-&gt;GetControlRotation();
        const FRotator YawRotation(0, Rotation.Yaw, 0);

        const FVector ForwardVector = FRotationMatrix(YawRotation).GetUnitAxis(EAxis::X);
        const FVector SideVector = FRotationMatrix(YawRotation).GetUnitAxis(EAxis::Y);

        // Add Movement Input
        AddMovementInput(ForwardVector, InputVector.Y);
        AddMovementInput(SideVector, InputVector.X);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>What I noticed is that when i'm moving right and press the left direction key the character changes directions without having to let go of the right direction key, but the opposite doesnt happen.
I want to be able to make the last input override the previous one without having to let go of the first input if they are in opposite directions. Functioning like snaptap.
Does anyone have an idea of how should i go about it to get the desired behaviour?</p>
<p>I tried this other code:</p>
<pre><code>void APlayerCharacter::MoveRightForward(const FInputActionValue&amp; Value)
{
    FVector2D InputVector = Value.Get&lt;FVector2D&gt;();

    if (IsValid(Controller))
    {
        // Get Forward and Side Directions based on the Yaw
        const FRotator Rotation = Controller-&gt;GetControlRotation();
        const FRotator YawRotation(0, Rotation.Yaw, 0);

        const FVector ForwardVector = FRotationMatrix(YawRotation).GetUnitAxis(EAxis::X);
        const FVector SideVector = FRotationMatrix(YawRotation).GetUnitAxis(EAxis::Y);

        // Apply movement only for positive input values (right and forward)
        if (InputVector.X &gt; 0.0f) // Right movement
        {
            AddMovementInput(SideVector, InputVector.X);
        }
        if (InputVector.Y &gt; 0.0f) // Forward movement
        {
            AddMovementInput(ForwardVector, InputVector.Y);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>This makes the character stand still in place if inputs in opposite directions are pressed at the same time.</p>

Basically I have a parent state with an enter condition that is true (in this example SomeTaskThatNestedStatesRequire). That enter condition has a task assigned to it that does something like filters actors or whatever. If the filter fails and it isn't able to find a valid target. I want the state to jump to the idle state. I know that if you call &quot;FinishTask&quot; in a state tree task, it triggers a re-evaluation of the tree if my understanding is correct. So I guess what would the best/correct way be to setup a state where if the &quot;filter&quot; task fails, the branch is skipped?</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/CE7W44rk.webp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/CE7W44rk.webp"" alt=""Example of problematic state tree layout"" /></a></p>
<p>The task, in this case &quot;STT_Find_Actor_Test&quot; may be a computationally expensive task, so I don't want it running every update. That is why I'm using an enter condition. That said the task which in this case is supposed to find an actor may fail if there are no valid actors. In this scenario I would like the tree to move onto the idle state. I have tried calling the &quot;FinishTask&quot; function in the STT_Find_Actor_Test when the task fails to find anything, hoping that I could use a transition with a condition to handle it like so:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/TpcUWHnJ.webp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/TpcUWHnJ.webp"" alt=""Example of attempted solution"" /></a></p>
<p>Seemingly though these transitions aren't intended to handle transitioning into child state, since it appears the &quot;Wait&quot; state is already active by the time STT_Find_Actor_Test calls FinishTask.</p>
<p>I think I could use an global task, or evaluator to run the STT_Find_Actor_Test every tick and use its result to drive the enter condition, but like I said, some of these tasks can be computationally expensive.</p>
<p>Anyway, if anyone knows the &quot;fix&quot; or if I'm doing this completely wrong and there is a better way I'm up for anything at this point! Thanks.</p>

I noticed spline point 2 and 3 (the last two before closing the loop) have flipped forward vectors, which causes my spline meshes to flip also. It's not clear to me why the flips happen, and how to flip them back again.</p>
<p>This is the code I’m using:</p>
<pre><code>{
    if (!SplineComponent) return;
    SplineComponent-&gt;ClearSplinePoints(false);

    // Add spline points in a circle, constrained to Y and Z axes
    const int32 NumberOfPoints = 4;
    for (int32 i = 0; i &lt; NumberOfPoints; ++i)
    {
        float Angle = (i / static_cast&lt;float&gt;(NumberOfPoints)) * 2.0f * PI;
        float Y = SplineRadius * FMath::Cos(Angle);
        float Z = SplineRadius * FMath::Sin(Angle);
        float X = 0.0f;  // X remains constant in my use case

        FVector Position(X, Y, Z);
        FVector Tangent = FVector(0.0f, -SplineRadius * FMath::Sin(Angle), SplineRadius * FMath::Cos(Angle));
        SplineComponent-&gt;AddSplinePoint(Position, ESplineCoordinateSpace::Local, false);
        SplineComponent-&gt;SetTangentAtSplinePoint(i, Tangent, ESplineCoordinateSpace::Local, false);
    }
    SplineComponent-&gt;UpdateSpline();
}
</code></pre>
<p>Anybody have some ideas how I can fix the forward vector flips?</p>
<p>What I tried is changing the up vector upon creation of the spline meshes, but it looked like it had no effect (perhaps UpdateSpline() re-flips them ...) and I also tried &quot;forcing&quot; a rotation in the code, but it usually ends up rotating the entire spline, rather than the meshes.</p>

<p>Both cases give me <strong>different</strong> results. Is this by design?</p>
<h2>Expected Result</h2>
<p>Case 1 should be equal to case 2 in all aspects.</p>
<h2>Phenomenon in Detail</h2>
<ul>
<li>In case 1, <code>filteredResult</code> is an array as expected.</li>
<li>In case 2, <code>filteredResult</code> is also an array with the same number of elements as case 1, but there is always one invalid element in this array. The values in this invalid element are unpredictable, like a pointer with all its properties released.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Environment</h2>
<p>Unreal Engine 5.4</p>
<h2>Things Tried</h2>
<ol>
<li>In Unreal Engine 5.4's source code, it's 100% reproducible on my PC.</li>
<li>I've tried some simple cases in a C++-only context without using UE in VS Code, using only <code>std::vector</code> and <code>std::shared_ptr</code>, but failed to reproduce this issue.</li>
<li>Using a plain old for loop in the code before gives the same result, so it's not an issue with <code>Algo</code>.</li>

    return vertexNodes;
}
</code></pre>
<h3>Some Thoughts</h3>
<ol>
<li>I should copy all the <code>TArray</code> related code to C++ to try to reproduce this in VS Code, but I'm overwhelmed by C++. The memory management of <code>TArray</code> seems incomprehensible to me as a junior C++ learner.</li>
<li>I really want to use chaining in C++, just like in some other languages. (Not using chaining in this case seems verbose to me.)</li>

<p>I'm building a custom volumetric atmosphere rendering system in Unreal Engine for flight training simulation. Target hardware is an Ada 5000 (~RTX4090) gpu or above. My current system represents cloud layers as tileable signed distance field volume textures, and raymarches them along with other atmospheric effects in a post process pass. The system works well except at high altitudes where cloud tiling is visible. I want to take the cloud data format to the next level by eliminating tiling artifacts and support hand placed storm clouds. A BVH or cluster grid is so enticing to me because it would enable instanced random variation and local weather effects.</p>
<p>I would appreciate any help or reading suggestions.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/lhLcj.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PackagingError</a></p>
<p>You can see in the image that Output Log says that it Failed to install Android SDK r25b.. but in Unreal Engine Documentaion -&gt; Android -&gt; Development Requirements it says that the NDK (not SDK) needs to be r25b..so I'm confused</p>
<p>I installed the latest Android Studio on its default location</p>
<p>After that I read Unreal Documentation on how to set up android SDK and NDK and I tried to run packaging and had a bunch of errors that I can't really remember. And this same error I have now was between all of the others. The errors were there because I didn't set up the SDK Tools properly.So I started following this video:</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMkl5FdtvP8&amp;list=PLd_lmWO1xgx0LBJO3z2ELjW9jHorXf897&amp;index=103"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMkl5FdtvP8&amp;list=PLd_lmWO1xgx0LBJO3z2ELjW9jHorXf897&amp;index=103</a></p>
<p>After installing and setting up all of the SDK,NDK and JDK files (In Android Studio and after in Unreal Engine) it started to pack. Even this &quot;-noninteractive failed&quot; error was not there.
But when it cooked up everything in the end I had this error message that resulted in package failure:</p>
<p><code>Could not initialize class org.codehaus.groovy.vmplugin.v7.Java7</code></p>
<p>Then I found this youtube video:
<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAYEpiTgeXI&amp;list=PLd_lmWO1xgx0LBJO3z2ELjW9jHorXf897&amp;index=104"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAYEpiTgeXI&amp;list=PLd_lmWO1xgx0LBJO3z2ELjW9jHorXf897&amp;index=104</a></p>
<p>It basically helped me understand that I was missing JRE files and that I shouldn't set the location of JAVA on JDK location but on JRE location:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/IZkQn.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">JRELocation</a></p>
<p>But I followed setting up everything in this video, even the setting up SDK and NDK Tools (Android Studio Setup part of that video)... which was clearly a mistake because after that it didn't even register the android platform as it should (It had a triangle warning sign next to it).I've managed to get back most of the settings that made it start packing before tinkering with the SDK Tools again..the emphasys on most..</p>
<p>So now I am back with this error that I don't know how was fixed in the first place. And when I go to SetupAndroid.bat file in the engine root, open it with Notepad++ and search for -noninteractive in order to try and see the code for google exploring about it I get only this:</p>
<pre><code>IF &quot;%5&quot; == &quot;-noninteractive&quot; (
    set PAUSE=
) ELSE (
    set PAUSE=pause
)
</code></pre>
<p>When I try and google the error I've posted here it leads me to setting up SDK's..But some of the SDK's were set up automatically when I followed the first video from Alex Pearce and I can't remember how it was set up before following the video from Nils Gallist. These are the settings that I have now in Android Studio:</p>
<p>-SDK Build Tools:

-NDK:

79078317,Unreal Input Action vs. Keyboard Event,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79078317/unreal-input-action-vs-keyboard-event,0,1728651149,"keyboard-events, unreal-engine5, enhanced-input-system","<p>Why should I set up an enhanced input action event when I can simply use a keyboard event in the game controller? The keyboard button will have no other functions and a change by the user is not required.
Or is there no real benefit for an input action in this case?</p>
","<p>friend!<br />
That is actually a great question, so let me try to clear things out.<br />
If you wanted to simply: call method when W is pressed, then any solution for this would be correct. But in a real world scenario that's is really never gonna happen. There will always be some &quot;what ifs&quot; at one point or another that will force you to increment the logic of capturing the W key. That's where the Enhance Input System comes in.<br />
So, basically the Enhanced Input System is not just a &quot;different way&quot; to handle hardware input. Is THE way of handling hardware input. That's because, although more complex to implement, it comes ready to handle an array of different situations.<br />
I'll try to give some examples that you would have to learn how to work around if you were to use direct capture of <em>Key Press</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Enhanced Input System can map different inputs to the same action:</strong> In your example, what happens if the player uses a controller in the future? You would need a different logic to capture every different input type. Not in Enhanced Input. In you Enhanced Input Mapping edit window you can define multiple different inputs to the same action. Meaning that no code has to be updated if you decide that a new key should or should not fire a certain action.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Input System can handle runtime remapping:</strong> Let's say you are using the usual WASD for movement but you decide that your player can rebind his keys in the Options menu. What you do? Now you need a way to capture every possible keyboard and controller input that he could use and then compare it to some other data to decide what type of mapping he is using now. Not with Enhanced Input. You can in runtime access an Input Mapping Context and update its structure, and its literally as simple has <code>IMC-&gt;UnmapKey() / IMC-&gt;MapKey()</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Input System can differentiate input types:</strong> Let's say that your player can press E to open a door and he can also hold E to bash it. There's really one way you could handle this without Enhanced Input System: You have to keep track of all subsequent frames that your player have pressed a given key and, depending of the time pressed, perform a certain action. If you try to imagine this just for a second on a client/server type of scenario you will understand how prone to failure this is. Well, not with Enhanced Input system. You can just enter your Input Action edit window, add a Trigger for Hold and define how many seconds before triggering your action. Even if it should be fired only once or should be affected by time dilation. I am not kidding when I say that, if you wanted to build something similar by hand somehow in blueprints, it could take you months to achieve the same result. I'm not kidding. Not only that but Input Actions can easily differentiate between actions that should be fired only once per action and when. And it's so simple to use.</li>
<li><strong>Switching mappings on the fly:</strong> Let's say you need your character to <code>Jump</code> when the player presses Space Bar, but if he's under water he needs to <code>Swim Up</code>. You could keep track of all different player states in your game and define a different logic for each key and each state, or you could just switch mapping inputs. If you simply switch map inputs (or work smartly with their priority), you need no new logic whatsoever. Just bind every player state to a Input Mapping Context (if there's need of one) and when the player changes state, it changes the mapping. Simple.</li>
<li><strong>Different events for different moments of the input:</strong> Let's say that you need your player to keep walking forward while hold W. BUT, you need to fire a specific method in the first frame he presses W and in the last frame he was pressing W (to handle triggering animations, let's say). I won't even start explaining how you would work with this with direct Key Press capture because it's not worth it. BUT, in Enhanced Input System you can define different methods for the same actions at different Events of the input. For instance, you have the Started event, which will be only called in the first frame a key is pressed. Or the Completed event, that will be fired in the last frame. Every event belonging to the same Input Action can be bound to a different method in your script. Completely removing the necessity of any logic to evaluate the type of event you are receiving whatsoever.</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm going to be honest, I could keep going but I think I made my point and I'm also working on a Youtube video about this and I don't want to spoil it all here. xD<br />
Anyway, I hope I could help and, trust me, Enhanced Input System is the way to go.</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/0bTJE51C.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This is the onrail event which attach my firstPerson character on a spline and move it around</a></p>
<p>as seen on the picture. i also got a widget where the player can select the rail button this is the event on is</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/MBXYPC2p.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This is the on button click event where if the player press the button it triggers the onrail event </a></p>
<p>The problem is on the third picture :</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/lSF6Xt9F.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">This is the problematic part, where if any key got pressed on rail, the game mode goes back to free roam mode</a></p>
<p>Where i got the any key event if it got triggered i check if the previous game mode was the on rail and if so it set it back to free roam, unhide the crosshair widget set the actor location to the player start location set the input mode to game only  and stop the timeline..  it runs down, but when the player got back to the player start position , it doesn't move anymore.. the mouse look works fine, just the movement input gets ignored somehow.. i set the debug view on and the EnhancedInputAction IA_Move gets triggered, but the character itself doesn't move.. I wonder if anybody here have any suggestion what could be the problem ??</p>

To optimize rendering, I’ve merged large sections (e.g., all bones, all veins) into single meshes. I still need to interact with individual parts, so I’ve kept the unmerged mesh for collision detection during ray casting. This setup lets me click on the merged model and get the correct part of the body in the console.</p>
<p>Previously, I had a setup using individual meshes, where I wrote to a custom depth buffer to highlight selected parts, following <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGqlReFObYQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> tutorial, and it worked great.</p>
<p>Now, I’ve tried combining both approaches—highlighting individual parts while displaying the merged model. However, this caused the &quot;picker mesh&quot; to be rendered on top of the merged model. To fix this, I disabled the picker mesh from the main scene pass, but then the picker mesh appeared black and was still quite expensive to render. On the plus side, the highlighting worked.</p>
<p>To improve FPS, I made the picker mesh completely transparent. Performance improved significantly, and I could still click and get the right intersection, but the highlighting no longer worked.</p>
<p>Could someone help me figure out how to get the highlighting working again without losing the performance boost?</p>

I use it for hobby projects in Unreal Engine.</p>
<p>I wanted to fully delete a project + its depot, to free up space. I have done this in the past successfully, and so attempted the same method: first running &quot;obliterate&quot; on the depot from within P4Admin (using context menus) as instructed by documentation.</p>
<p>But when I tried to then delete the depot itself I got errors claiming there were still files in the depot. But I could not see any files, the folder in explorer and depot tree was entirely empty.</p>
<p>It also told me that I could bypass this error by running 'p4 depot -d -f depotname', which I did through Windows CLI. It reported success, and the depot is indeed now gone from P4V visual client and that folder completely empty on my computer.</p>
<p><strong>However, my EC2 instance still shows 6.8/30GB in use</strong> (the amount in use before deletion). <strong>I can't figure out how to get it to recognize or &quot;sync&quot; with the fact that this depot has been deleted.</strong></p>
<p>When I list files on the EC2 I see this:
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/E4BnDF6Z.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">results of ls command</a></p>
<p>That &quot;depot&quot; highlighted in blue I can only assume IS the depot that's supposed to be deleted, but it's still there.</p>

<p><code>-bash: p4: command not found</code></p>
<p>Please give any advice at ELI5 level. I don't have a background in server admin stuff. Thanks for any help.</p>
","<blockquote>
<p>But when I tried to then delete the depot itself I got errors claiming there were still files in the depot. But I could not see any files, the folder in explorer and depot tree was entirely empty.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a whole bunch of different &quot;views&quot; of the depot (i.e. different sets of files that you might be talking about when you talk about &quot;depot files&quot;) and it sounds like you might be looking at one while trying to diagnose the other.  These are the three that I think are relevant:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The depot files that you currently have synced to your local workspace.  (When you say &quot;folder in explorer&quot;, I assume you're talking about files in a Windows workspace, not the files on the actual EC2 server.)  This will only be one (or no) revision of the actual depot files, depending on what exactly you've synced.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The files that are tracked in the server metadata as logically belonging to that depot.  This is what you see when you look at the &quot;depot tree&quot; in P4V, or when you run <code>p4 files //depot/...</code> at the command line.  Each depot file has multiple revisions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The &quot;archive files&quot; on the server that are the source of truth for the actual file contents.  <strong>These are the files that actually take up space on EC2.</strong>  Sometimes the files in one depot will actually be references (&quot;lazy copies&quot;) from a <em>different</em> depot -- it is possible for <code>//depot/...</code> to have a million files in the depot tree and no archive files at all in the corresponding server folder -- or vice versa!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you obliterate a depot and then can't delete it because there are still archive files (I think the actual error message will specify &quot;archive files&quot; as opposed to &quot;depot files&quot; -- this is an important detail!), it means that some other depot has files with references to the obliterated depot's archive files; if you were to delete that depot, those references become invalidated and you end up losing content from the other depot that you <em>weren't</em> trying to delete.</p>
<p>With all that explanation out of the way, here is the fix (assuming you're trying to delete the depot called <code>depot</code>):</p>
<pre><code>p4 snap //... //depot/...
p4 depot -d depot
rm -rf depot
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>p4 snap</code> command turns the &quot;lazy copies&quot; into actual duplicated archives; this will basically just take that 8GB that was under the <code>depot</code> directory on your server and copy it into whatever other depot has a dependency.  You <em>only</em> ever want to use that <code>snap</code> command if you're planning to <code>rm -rf</code> the folder you just &quot;snapped&quot;.  Once you've snapped the archives, <code>p4 depot -d</code> shouldn't complain about existing files any more.</p>
<p>The actual <code>rm -rf</code> needs to be run on EC2.  Snapping doesn't actually delete the archive files, it just copies them, so you need to delete them from the filesystem.  Once the depot has been snapped and deleted this is perfectly safe.</p>

<p>I can't find anything on the internet, so I can't imagine that it is something that many people have had trouble getting past.</p>
<p>Attached is the blueprints for my working actor. Thanks
(<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/nHiKfFPN.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://i.sstatic.net/nHiKfFPN.png</a>)</p>
<p>I have tried creating 2 spline paths and 2 actors, 1 spline path and 2 actors, 2 spline paths and 1 actor, but nothing has worked.</p>
<p>I was expecting to have 2 actors moving in one direction down both spline paths, which then regenerate at the start and go again.</p>
<p>Instead, I only ever have 1 actor moving down 1 of the spline paths, which then regenerates at the start and goes again.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The mass of the first particle at index <code>0</code> stands out immediately because it's the total mass of the whole object. So, I assume that is the root node named <code>SM_ChamferCube</code> in the screenshot above.</p>
<p>The following three particles at index <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code> have masses that add up to the mass of the first particle (53194.617188 + 30795.964844 + 16009.417969 = 100000.000000) so I assume those are <code>SM_ChamferCube_0</code>, <code>SM_ChamferCube_1</code>, and <code>SM_ChamferCube_2</code></p>
","<p>The method <code>GeometryCollectionComponent-&gt;GetParentArrayRest()</code> gets any particle index's parent index. There are also 13 values in this array, and they look like this:</p>
<pre><code>-1
0
0
0
1
1
1
2
2
2
3
3
3
</code></pre>
<p>The index <code>0</code> parent is <code>-1</code> because it's the root. The parent of indexes <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, and <code>3</code> is index <code>0</code>. The rest of the particles are real, having parent <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, or <code>3</code>. Any particle that's the parent of another particle isn't real; it's a &quot;cluster union particle.&quot;</p>
<p>So, we can determine how many cluster union particle groups are in the geometry collection by iterating over the parent array, finding the highest index + 1, and storing that value as <code>FirstRealParticleIndex</code> to use as the beginning of any loop that's supposed to iterate over only the real particles.</p>

But so far, I've only got the relative translation of the particle. So in the following code, before the geometry collection has broken apart from the original rest collection, all the particle translations are [0, 0, 0]:</p>

<p>I think I am on the right track with <code>Particle-&gt;GetP()</code> or <code>Particle-&gt;GetX()</code>. Also I've noticed that the particle at index 0 has some special behavior.</p>
","<p>The answer is basically <code>Particle-&gt;GetX()</code> after getting a particle from the geometry collection physics proxy, <em><strong>but</strong></em> a major gotcha is that particles only update their location when they break off.</p>
<p>This code comment from <strong>GeometryCollectionEngine</strong> -&gt; <strong>GeometryCollectionComponent.cpp:2135</strong> sheds some light on this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Clusters always fracture with one off pieces being removed.
This means we only need to record the one offs that broke and we get the connected components for free.
If the first child is disabled it means the properties apply to the parent (i.e. the cluster).
If the first child is enabled it means it's a one off and the cluster IS the first child</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ergo, we must check if each particle is disabled, and if it is, use its parent location.</p>

The other views are showing just the Sky_Sphere and nothing else.</p>
<p>I haven't made any significant changes to the settings that could have caused this. It seems to have happened out of nowhere. Does anyone have any insights into what might be causing this issue or how to resolve it?</p>

Here’s my setup:</p>
<ol>
<li>I run the .exe file with these arguments: <code>-AudioMixer -PixelStreamingIP=localhost -PixelStreamingPort=8888</code>.</li>
<li>I run the Pixel Streaming web server from the official GitHub repository.</li>
<li>The .exe running on the server has audio, and I’ve tested both audio from Blueprints and in-scene audio (importing audio in the Content Browser and adding them to the scene), but once I connect through the browser, there’s no audio at all.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve tried multiple virtual audio solutions like VB-Cable, VoiceMeeter, and others, but none seem to fix the issue. The game runs perfectly in the browser on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, but the audio just won’t play, both local and from remote access.</p>
<p>I am using a temporary workaround, but it’s not ideal.</p>
<p>I added the PixelStreamingAudioComponent to the scene and set the browser (where Unreal + Pixel Streaming are running on the remote server) to use VB-Cable Output as the microphone and open the stream link (127.0.0.1). This allows the browser to capture everything from the system’s audio output and sends it to the PixelStreaming server.</p>
<p>To prevent a feedback loop, I disabled audio for the browser, Unreal, and Cable Output in the Audio Mixer.</p>
<p>This is a hacky solution, and a more native fix would be preferable, but I haven’t found one yet.</p>
<p>How to fix this problem?</p>

<li>Unreal version is 5.3.2</li>
<li>Pixel Streaming version is the latest from the Github repository (branch 5.3)</li>
<li>OS where Pixel Streaming runs is Windows 10</li>

Then, once we are satisfied, we replicate it to all clients connected. How would this be achieved?</p>
<p>I have the following code, I can spawn a replicating actor on the server:
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/9FHrO.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Spawn actor on server</a></p>

<p>But this would ruin the idea of replication, since it's &quot;controlled by the server&quot; so that anything that happens on the server propagates to each of the clients who it's replicated to. Therefore, we would have to create our own backend for replication.</p>
<p>I know there is a thing called &quot;replication condition&quot; that you can add to a replicating properties. However, I am unsure how to achieve this with c++, let alone blueprints. I can do both, but blueprints is preferred.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance, I'm having a lot of trouble understanding this.</p>
","<p>i'm not entirely sure. but you can spawn the actor on the server, set the appropriate owner. and on the actor you can override a function that determines if it's relevant for a specific client.

The error seems related to the PositionCorrectionCurve of the Mantle asset, but I’m unsure how to resolve it. Here’s what I’ve tried so far:
1. Verified the Mantle asset exists and is properly configured.
2. Checked the related curve asset for the Mantle, but I couldn't find any obvious issues.
3. Made sure my project is compatible with the ALS version (which was initially designed for Unreal Engine 4.24 but migrated to 5.1).

Has anyone encountered this issue or know how to fix it? Any help or suggestions would be appreciated!

It seems like, there are additional shadows of a character that were cut by a rectangle or smth, and they appear when character moves at a certain angle to camera(like 45 or 135)

<p>I assume the problem is in my mesh or my skeleton (I use a custom one(somehow without a &quot;root&quot; bone, if that is important)) or in material (this is less likely, mats consist only color maps,but maybe). When I rotate camera, the shadows disappear. The cloth simulation doesn't work as well.

78916254,Perforce won’t let me add files to depot because “file(s) not in client view.” for my unreal engine project,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78916254/perforce-won-t-let-me-add-files-to-depot-because-files-not-in-client-view-f,0,1724705583,"perforce, unreal-engine5, unreal, perforce-client-spec","<p>So here’s my situation. I have a desktop perforce server that I already have a project on for a group game project for one of my classes. The server keeps all of those files in a depot called “depot” because I was new to perforce and I just named it that. After a bit the project grew and I have a full game project stored in there. Since I’m not working on that game project anymore, I’ve started a new project and I wanted to use my already setup perforce desktop server. I’m using Perforce Helix P4V to access the server, its the GUI if that matters.</p>
<p>So I followed this guide:
<a href=""https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/tutorials/BEqk/unreal-engine-adding-additional-projects-to-perforce-using-p4v-as-simply-as-possible"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://dev.epicgames.com/community/learning/tutorials/BEqk/unreal-engine-adding-additional-projects-to-perforce-using-p4v-as-simply-as-possible</a></p>
<p>I found it really helpful until I got to the part where you add your workspace files. I created a new depot called ProjectMomentos and created a new workspace with a new folder and copy and pasted the unreal engine project into that workspace folder. The files show up in perforce but their only showing up because I filtered it to “show files not in depot”. Theirs something I’m doing wrong but I can’t figure it out. Whenever I try to add those workspace files, a bunch of warning messages pop up and say this unreal engine asset “file(s) not in client view.” I’ve been trying to fix this for hours but nothing seems to work. It will say “no files opened” “311 warnings reported” before showing all the warnings. If anyone can help, I would seriously appreciate it.</p>
<p>So I tired switching and mapping different depots. Didn't work. Created and deleted 10+ workspaces to keep testing but nothing worked. Extremely stuck</p>
<p>Update:</p>
<p>Tried the &quot;p4 client -o&quot; command and here is what I got back</p>

For some reason:</p>
<pre><code>//ProjectMomentos/... //Test5/ProjectMomentos/...
//ProjectMomentos/ProjectMausoleum/... //Test5/ProjectMausoleum/...

<p>this is what worked. I'm not exactly sure why this worked. But it worked</p>

Looking around online seemed to indicate that moving a project in UE5 should be as simple as moving the folder, and in most respects the transfer seemed to work - but when attempting to compile C++ files with Live Coding, the compiler fails.

This tutorial is basically an explainer for how the Third Party Library plugin template works behind the scenes. However, when I try to replicate the tutorial’s goal with the Third Party Library template itself, it gives a bunch of missing file errors and linker errors. Particularly, I noticed that the build.cs file of the blank template has CoreUObject, Engine, Slate, and SlateCore in the private dependencies, and it compiles just fine with those. However, adding those dependencies in the Third Party Library plugin template results in a bunch of linker errors.</p>
<p>I matched the files one to one, but I couldn’t find out why this happens. Is this a bug, or am I missing some linking commands somewhere that gets issued with the blank template but not the third party one?</p>

I feel very confused about some of reflection code in shader. Here is an shader example in <code>AnisotropyRendering.cpp</code>.</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>class FAnisotropyVS : public FMeshMaterialShader
{
public:
    DECLARE_SHADER_TYPE(FAnisotropyVS, MeshMaterial);

    static bool ShouldCompilePermutation(const FMeshMaterialShaderPermutationParameters&amp; Parameters)
    {
        // Compile if supported by the hardware.

    FAnisotropyVS() = default;
    FAnisotropyVS(const ShaderMetaType::CompiledShaderInitializerType&amp; Initializer)
        : FMeshMaterialShader(Initializer)
    {}
};
</code></pre>
<p>After expanding <code>DECLARE_SHADER_TYPE</code> macro, I found some piece of code</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>private:
  using InternalBaseType = typename TGetBaseTypeHelper&lt;FAnisotropyVS&gt;::Type;
  template &lt;typename InternalType&gt;
  static void InternalInitializeBases(FTypeLayoutDesc &amp;TypeDesc) {
    TInitializeBaseHelper&lt;InternalType, InternalBaseType&gt;::Initialize(TypeDesc);
  };
public:

    ;
    static inline __attribute__((always_inline)) void

</code></pre>
<p><strong>The confused thing is, compiler tells me <code>InternalBaseType</code> is actually a type alias of <code>FMeshMaterialShader</code>, but it seems to me that <code>InternalBaseType</code> should be a alias of <code>FAnisotropyVS</code>.</strong></p>
<p><code>TGetBaseTypeHelper</code> template defined in <code>MemoryLayout.h</code></p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>template&lt;typename T&gt;

    template&lt;typename InternalType&gt; static void Test(...);

    using Type = decltype(Test&lt;T&gt;(nullptr));
};
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Because <code>FAnisotropyVS::DerivedType</code> is just <code>FAnisotropyVS</code>. I can't see why <code>InternalBaseType</code> is a alias of <code>FMeshMaterialShader</code>(base type)</strong></p>
<p>I will very appreciate it if someone can enlighten me what happens here. Though this is a very small implementation problem and nobody cares...</p>
","<p>In class FMeshMaterialShader</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>class RENDERER_API FMeshMaterialShader : public FMaterialShader
{
    DECLARE_TYPE_LAYOUT(FMeshMaterialShader, NonVirtual);

<p>This macro will be expanded into some code and a piece of it like this</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>public:
    using DerivedType = FMeshMaterialShader;
</code></pre>
<p>now the DerivedType is FMeshMaterialShader.</p>
<p>when class FAnisotropyVS inherits class FMeshMaterialShader.</p>
<p>class FAnisotropyVS looks like this</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>class FAnisotropyVS : public FMeshMaterialShader
{
   // The declaration of FMeshMaterialShader

   //... some code

   // The declaration of FAnisotropyVS its own
public:
    DECLARE_SHADER_TYPE(FAnisotropyVS, MeshMaterial);
};
</code></pre>
<p>Now when <code>DECLARE_SHADER_TYPE(FAnisotropyVS, MeshMaterial);</code> expand like this</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>private:
  using InternalBaseType = typename TGetBaseTypeHelper&lt;FAnisotropyVS&gt;::Type;
  // Some code ...
public:
  using DerivedType = FAnisotropyVS;

<p>The <code>DerivedType</code> is still <code>FMeshMaterialShader</code>, because <code>using DerivedType = FAnisotropyVS;</code> is after this piece of code.</p>
<p>So <code>InternalBaseType</code> in <code>FAnisotropyVS</code> is alias of <code>FMeshMaterialShader</code></p>

These modules are structured as Epic Games recommends (with private and public folders containing .cpp and .h files, respectively). <code>OrbitSuite</code> is a private dependency  of <code>CelBody</code> as it contains a data structure called <code>FBodyData</code> which is the type of one of the <code>ACelBody</code> actor class' member attributes.</p>
<p>The OrbitSuite and CelBody module folders inhabit the same source directory of my Unreal project and #includes are spelled correctly and IntelliSense shows zero issues regarding missing headers or unresolved members. In CelBody.Build.cs, OrbitSuite is included in the PrivateDependencyModuleNames string list which is unedited since the last time the project compiled successfully.</p>

<p>Looking up the error code, it apparently signals &quot;when a declaration exists in a header file, but no matching definition is implemented&quot; and, in this case, is referring to <code>FBodyData</code>'s default constructor as it is called by the declaration of member <code>FBodyData BodyData</code> in the class definition of <code>ACelBody</code>. I've quadruple checked BodyData.h and BodyData.cpp and the default constructor is defined and implemented correctly.</p>
<p>I'd expect the compiler to have no issue locating the implementation of <code>FBodyData()</code> and fear the error may be caused by something unrelated. Let me know if there are logs it would be helpful to provide or if any more detail is required regarding file structure or class implementation.</p>

<p>I found out that you can use sockets, but since I am <strong>NOT</strong> using a mesh I don't think I can use <strong>sockets</strong>. In some tutorials, the tutor was using a static mesh with no 'mesh' assigned as the child of the first-person camera. And then he would replace the static mesh 'mesh' with the mesh of the picked-up item. This is not an option for me because I want the player to be able to pick up guns, torches rocks, etc.</p>

78809431,Is it possible for a quaternion to represent a rotation pass 180 degree?,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78809431/is-it-possible-for-a-quaternion-to-represent-a-rotation-pass-180-degree,1,1722300341,"animation, math, rotation, quaternions, unreal-engine5","<p>I am wondering if quaternions can be used to represent a rotation that is beyond 180 but below 360 degrees?</p>
<p>I am asking this in the context of Unreal Engine's FQuat library where my combined quaternion has a rotation greater than 180 degrees, and it will flip the direction of the resulting quaternion.</p>
<p>Is this unique to Unreal Engine? Or is there something more to quaternions, that I am not aware of?</p>
<p>Any guidance is appreciated, Thanks!</p>
<p>For example, if I combined two 95 degree clockwise quaternions, I expect a 190 degree clockwise quaternion. But in Unreal Engine, it would give a 80 degree counter clockwise quaternion.</p>
","<p>Yes, as long as you don't try to keep the sign of the scalar part positive. E.g., here is MATLAB code that forms a quaternion q with a 95 degree rotation. Then multiply by itself to get a quaternion p with a 190 degree rotation. Note that the scalar part of p is negative (scalar is first in MATLAB). Then extract the angles of these two quaternions with the atan2d() function to show that you can recover the angle greater than 180:</p>
<p>The code:</p>
<pre><code>angle = 95 % degrees
q = quaternion(cosd(angle/2),sind(angle/2),0,0) % form quaternion with 95 degree rotation
p = q * q % form quaternion with 190 degree rotation 
[a,b,c,d] = q.parts; % extract quaternion parts ...
qd = [a,b,c,d]; % ... and form as double vector
[a,b,c,d] = p.parts; % extract quaternion parts ...
pd = [a,b,c,d]; % ... and form as double vector
atan2d(norm(qd(2:4)),qd(1))*2 % extract angle of q
atan2d(norm(pd(2:4)),pd(1))*2 % extract angle of p
</code></pre>
<p>The result of running the code:</p>
<pre><code>angle =
    95
q = 
  quaternion
     0.67559 + 0.73728i +       0j +       0k
p = 
  quaternion
    -0.087156 +  0.99619i +        0j +        0k
ans =
    95
ans =
   190
</code></pre>
<p>I am unfamiliar with Unreal Engine and how it deals with quaternions, so can't advise you on that. But it sounds like maybe something in the way the quaternions are formed, or maybe something in the background angle calculations, is forcing the scalar part to be positive by flipping all of the signs?</p>
<p>This can actually be a potential problem with attitude control systems that try to move from one attitude to a nearby attitude. If you are not careful with the signs, the control system can inadvertently be sent the &quot;long&quot; way around instead of the short way. To prevent this, one would intentionally check the scalar sign first and adjust the calculations to force the short way is taken.</p>

","<p>AI MoveTo requires a navmesh. For a 2D game such as yours, I would avoid using AI MoveTo and instead move the Actor directly.</p>
<p>With that said, if you want to continue using AI MoveTo here are a couple of reasons why your MoveTo may not work:</p>
<ul>
<li>missing Navmesh</li>
<li>AI is spawned in at runtime (you'll want to set <code>Auto Possess AI</code> to <code>Placed in World or Spawned</code>)</li>

</ul>
<p>Both contain executables and debug symbols under <code>Engine/Binaries/</code>, but <code>Engine/Windows</code> also contains the engine source code.</p>
<p>Which is which? I've found several people asking the same question in the UE forums, but no one seems to have a conclusive answer.</p>
","<p>What would happen if the cache wasn't introduced in Computer Science? <br>
Please take a reference on the same page <a href=""https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/using-an-installed-build-of-unreal-engine"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Using An Installed Build for Unreal Engine</a>.
While making an installed build, I guess you have passed certain cmd line options; but wait there are more, and the one that produced the InstalledDDC directory is &quot;-WithDDC&quot; which is by default set to true, and it states that it
&quot;Build a stand-alone derived-data cache for the engine content and templates.&quot;</p>
<p>In a simple sense, InstalledDDC contains pre-computed data for things like materials, textures, and more, which makes your overall development faster.
Let's consider you have a large project, and now generating the files every time will make your GPU work harder and it will be slower.</p>
<p>So now coming to your question, you always need a build for the Unreal engine that's contained in the '../Engine/Windows' directory as it contains binaries, executables and other files required for running, and developing the project. However for the DDC, it's not essential, but highly beneficial cause it can turn tables by caching the data.</p>
<p>Now to keep this answer simple and brief, I will reference this <a href=""https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/using-derived-data-cache-in-unreal-engine"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Derived Data Cache</a>, and I'll let you decide if you need the derived data cache or not!</p>

Does Unreal have built-in support for this kind of conversion? Or if not, are there any third-party libraries or custom solutions I could use otherwise to achieve this functionality?</p>

<p>I'm not sure where these files are, what do I have to change, or even, if there are any important things I should know first about how C++ handles files/libraries. Any tips on how to understand it, and how to fix it, so it reaches those files? I think the setup of the project is fine (downloaded .NET 6, the regular Visual Studio for compiling, and added the Game tools for C++ optional dependency. I think that should suffice, or am I missing something?</p>

However, when making the last character and its AI, I ran into a bug.</p>
<p>An int32 Variable called &quot;Stage&quot; is causing problems and crashing the game every restart.</p>
<p><code>int32 Stage;</code></p>
<p>It is used in this BTTask:</p>
<pre><code>void UBTTask_FoxyCountdown::TimerCompleted(UBehaviorTreeComponent&amp; OwnerComp) const
{

}

<p>In PiratesCove:</p>
<pre><code>if (Foxy &amp;&amp; Mesh2) 
{ 
   if (Foxy-&gt;GetStage() &gt;= 2) 
</code></pre>
<pre><code></code></pre>
<p>And in the class itself: `</p>
<pre><code>void AFoxy::IncreaseStage()
{   
     Stage++;   
     UE_LOG(LogTemp, Log, TEXT(&quot;Increased Foxy's stage to: %d&quot;), Stage);        

     if (Stage &lt; 5)

void AFoxy::ResetStage()
{   
    Stage = 0;           
    SetActorLocation(FVector{0, 0, -100}); 
} 

int32 AFoxy::GetStage() const 
{   

   return Stage; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>Somewhere here, is crashing the game, and after some debugging(UE_LOGS that told me the number, and removing stage related code and it no longer crashing), it's Stage Being Used. This is strange because I have never seen an int32 get a usual pointer crash. One thing I noticed is that Stage somehow gets set to this specific number after a while: 1983924. And it is this number Every time without fail. Here is the level restart code:</p>
<pre><code>UNightInstance* Instance = Cast&lt;UNightInstance&gt;(GetGameInstance());
    
if (Instance)
{
    Instance-&gt;IncreaseNight();
    UE_LOG(LogTemp, Log, TEXT(&quot;NightNumber increased to: %d&quot;), Instance-&gt;NightNumber);

    if (Instance-&gt;NightNumber &gt;= 6)
    {
        Instance-&gt;ResetNightNumber();
        UE_LOG(LogTemp, Log, TEXT(&quot;NightNumber reset to: %d&quot;), Instance-&gt;NightNumber);
    }
        
    UGameplayStatics::OpenLevel(GetWorld(), DecidingLevel);
</code></pre>
<p>When it opens the level to decide if you want to go to the next map, apparently Foxy's Behavior Tree is still being used, and because its not in the world, its causing crashes??????? Why is it activating if ONLY THE PLAYER is in the world.</p>
<p>I've tried everything, and this is extremely demoralizing. Here is some answers to questions I have tried.</p>
<p>Please help, I've been stuck for so long</p>
<p>I tried:</p>
<p>1: I initialized the stage to 0 at begin play.
2: I check if everything is valid 3: I have a delay after the level so everything can load in.
3: Went to another level, waiting a while, and went to it.</p>
<p>No crashes after level restart.</p>

I have converted each asset into a Sprite.</p>
<p>In C++, I have subclassed a class <code>ASLBaseSpriteActor</code> from <code>APaperSpriteActor</code>, so that I can dynamically spawn various “items” in the world.</p>
<p>I’m struggling with dynamically setting which particular sprite should be used for a new spawned <code>ASLBaseSpriteActor</code>.</p>
<p>If I put this into the constructor:</p>
<pre><code>ASLBaseSpriteActor::ASLBaseSpriteActor() {
   UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT(&quot;ASLBaseSpriteActor::constructor&quot;));
   UPaperSprite* sprite = Cast&lt;UPaperSprite&gt;(StaticLoadObject(UPaperSprite::StaticClass(), NULL, TEXT(&quot;/Script/Paper2D.PaperSprite'/Game/Assets/Items/apple_Sprite.apple_Sprite'&quot;)));

      UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT(&quot;ASLBaseSpriteActor::Initialize got sptire&quot;));
      UPaperSpriteComponent* renderComponent = this-&gt;GetRenderComponent();
      if (renderComponent) {
         this-&gt;GetRenderComponent()-&gt;SetSprite(sprite);
         UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT(&quot;ASLBaseSpriteActor::Initialize got render comp&quot;));
      }
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>It works fine - I can see the “apple” item in the world upon spawning the <code>APaperSpriteActor</code>. The problem is that eventually, the path to the sprite will need to be a parameter. But, if I put the same block of code say into <code>BeginPlay</code>, I cannot see the item anymore in the world, although, based on my logs, all references to sprite and <code>renderComponent</code> are not null.</p>
<p>I have tried deferred spawning as well - from my game mode, I do:</p>
<pre><code>void ASLGameModeBase::BeginPlay() {
   UWorld* const World = GetWorld();
   if (World) {
      const FTransform SpawnLocAndRotation;
      ASLBaseSpriteActor* newItem = World-&gt;SpawnActorDeferred&lt;ASLBaseSpriteActor&gt;(ASLBaseSpriteActor::StaticClass(), SpawnLocAndRotation);
      newItem-&gt;Initialize();
      newItem-&gt;FinishSpawning(SpawnLocAndRotation);
   }
}
</code></pre>
<p>I tried putting the code from the <code>APaperSpriteActor</code> into the <code>APaperSpriteActor::Initialize</code> but that doesn’t work either.</p>
<p>I am out of ideas, aside from subclassing <code>APaperSpriteActor</code> for each of my items to just set the path to the sprite in the constructor. How can I achieve what I want with just a single <code>APaperSpriteActor</code> class that can dynamically attach a sprite to its instance when spawned in the world, based on a path parameter?</p>

Part of the reorg. involved renaming a package from <code>/OpenPF2Core</code> to <code>/OpenPF2</code>, for which we added this to <code>DefaultOpenPF2.ini</code> (since this is in a plugin; otherwise it would have gone in <code>DefaultEngine.ini</code>):</p>
<pre><code>[CoreRedirects]
+PackageRedirects=(OldName=&quot;/OpenPF2Core&quot;,NewName=&quot;/OpenPF2&quot;,MatchSubstring=true)

<pre><code>[/Script/GameplayAbilities.AbilitySystemGlobals]
+GameplayCueNotifyPaths=&quot;/OpenPF2/OpenPF2/Optional/Abilities/Attacks&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>If I change the <code>GameplayCueNotifyPaths</code> value, the warnings disappear, but the gameplay cue still fails to function.</p>
<p>How can I fix this issue?</p>
","<p>The real issue here is that the path inside each gameplay cue is using the old package name rather than the new package name, so when the cue gets discovered and loaded by the Gameplay Cue Manager (GCM) in the engine, it attempt to look for the old package instead of the new one, fails to find that package, and concludes that it is not mounted. Basically, package redirects don't affect package paths the GCM sees.</p>
<p>To fix this, I just needed to open up the Gameplay Cue blueprints in the editor, go to the &quot;File&quot; menu, select &quot;Refresh All nodes&quot; (sic), then compile and save the blueprint. After this, the log warnings disappeared and cues started working again.</p>
<p>You can see that this was the problem because the error message was citing the old path (<code>/OpenPF2Core</code>) rather than the new one. I also enabled additional logging (by adding the snippet below to <code>DefaultEngine.ini</code>) so I could confirm that all the packages were being mounted properly:</p>

I'm getting to the part where I want to implement search and filter functions. On the forefront of this is Cladistics, or the dino's &quot;family tree&quot;. I want Unreal to read the name of the dino or any of its groups, and know what larger groups they are in and what smaller groups they contain.</p>
<p>As a very simplified example I made a bird cladistics tree (Figure 1). I have an array with a list of birds, and I want Unreal to know that when I apply the &quot;Shorebird&quot; filter, it returns the Crane and Sandpiper. Since everything that's a Heron is also a Shorebird, it would include all Herons in that search as well. This is a very simplified version, since in real life dozens of animals can be a part of dozens of different groups.</p>
<p>So what would be the best way of categorizing/storing/accessing this information? Keep in mind, the crux of this project relies on the Google Sheet for easy collaboration and minimal app updates. I want there to be minimal blueprint tampering, so if someone adds a new group or subgroup In the sheet, it needs to be reflected in the app. I'm not looking for someone to write code for me, just to point me in the right direction.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/9qTNVMKN.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Figure1</a></p>
<p>I saw someone in Discord mention Data Tree Structures and Pointers and it sounds like exactly what I need, but I have no clue how to implement them or if they can be generated at runtime. I have a second image (Figure 2) summarizing what kind of logic I think would work. Getting the new entry, seeing what groups it belongs to, and making any new groups/pointers it needs. I mostly use and prefer blueprints, but am willing to learn some C++ if needed.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/6e31LyBM.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Figure2</a></p>
<p>Another consideration I am currently workshopping is using a String, where upon encountering a new group name, it assigns an index to associate with that group. Then if there is a group inside, it assigns <em>that</em> group an index and places it inside parenthesis, and so on. (Figure 3) Its like manually typing out an array. It's limited to 10 groups per 'layer' but it might work for my purposes.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/xFJFnWai.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Figure3</a></p>
","<p>SOLUTION:
Someone on the Unreal forums pointed me to JSON data, so I learned a little bit and got the VARest plugin. With a couple hours work I now have a dynamically updating cladistics list that hypothetically could extend to the entirity of all living things ever. So. Yeah I think this works for me :3</p>

<p>But the problem is, server pawn's movement is fine but client pawn doesn't move at all both on server and client.</p>
<p>I expected that after the player input keys, client pawn move upon the server's movement decision by the RPC movement function based on such key input.</p>
<p>But I can't find any other references like using RPC in Enhanced Input.</p>
<p>if there are other ways to Enhanced Input System can multiplay, please let me know.</p>

<p>The error I get:</p>
<pre><code>error C2660, function doesnt accept 3 arguments
</code></pre>
<p>What is the reason for that ?</p>
","<p><strong>The problem:</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/API/Runtime/Engine/GameFramework/AController/SetControlRotation/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>SetControlRotation</code></a> API requires 1 argument of type <code>FRotator</code>, not 3 separate ones for the rotation components (pitch, yaw, roll).</p>
<p>This is the meaning of the error you get (<code>error C2660, function doesnt accept 3 arguments</code>).</p>
<p><strong>You can fix it in one of the following ways:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Add a <code>FRotator</code> variable created from the 3 components and use it with the API:
<pre><code>FRotator rot = FRotator(Rotation.Pitch + amount*5, 
                        Rotation.Yaw, 
                        Rotation.Roll);
Controller-&gt;SetControlRotation(rot);
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>or:</p>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>Construct a <code>FRotator</code> object from the 3 components directly in the API call, like this:
<pre><code>Controller-&gt;SetControlRotation(
//--------------------vvvvvvvv--------------------------
                      FRotator(Rotation.Pitch + amount*5,

</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that although <code>FRotator</code> is composed of the 3 components, it is not the same (from the C++ point of view) as the 3 components given separatly.</p>

So after unsuccessfully trying to fix this issue I decided to rebuild the project in UE 5.3 (it was originally built in 4.17).
To make sure there wasn't anything wrong with the engine I first tried to package the project with only the main menu implemented and it worked.
So in the last couple of weeks I completely rebuilt the entire project and debugged it.
It runs smoothly when playing in editor, in standalone, when launching it and also when starting it in shipping mode from VS22.</p>
<p>But when I package the project and run the exe afterwards there is only a black screen and it says &quot;no response&quot; in the taskmanager.<br />
So there is no crash at all and all I can see is a black screen. I can also only shut it down with the task manager.</p>

<p>So far I tried to Fix the redirectors and also to uninstall Quixel Bridge and the WinPix plugin.</p>
<p>Also I have tried packaging this project on 2 different computers. 1 with win11 and 1 with win10. So I think the problem lies within my project but I don't really know where to search anymore. And since there is no crash there is no error that seems to be directly related to the exe not running.</p>
<p>When packaging the project I resolved all errors. But there are still some warnings that I ignored. But those also occur when compiling the project and shouldn't really make any difference.</p>

78586933,Why can I call a pointer&#39;s IsValidLowLevel() function without a null check?,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78586933/why-can-i-call-a-pointers-isvalidlowlevel-function-without-a-null-check,2,1717680454,"c++, unreal-engine5","<p>Good practice in UE5 is to make sure you're not calling a function on a nullptr.</p>
<p>One method of doing this would be calling the pointers IsValidLowLevel() function like follows...</p>
<pre><code>if (ActorPtr-&gt;IsValidLowLevel())
{
    ActorPtr-&gt;DoSomething();
}
</code></pre>
<p>But why does this actor pointer have guaranteed access to this function if it is indeed a nullptr? Shouldn't the program crash if you call a function on a nullptr the same as if I called the ActorPtr's DoSomething() function? And is there a difference in how these functions are called?</p>
<p>I'm also aware that there are other and probably better ways to nullcheck since it also does a bunch of other checks that might not be necessary, but I'm just curious why you can even do this in the first place.</p>
<p>I've checked out UE5's documentation on this function, but it's super helpful and says that it does a nullcheck and doesn't go into how it does it.</p>
","<p>Dereferencing a <code>nullptr</code> is <a href=""https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/ub"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">undefined behavior</a>. A crash is not guaranteed, <em>anything</em> (literally) is allowed to happen and the compiler is <em>not</em> required to warn you about it - it can just assume it never happens (because if it did, that would mean you break the rules and then it's allowed to do <em>whatever</em>). And if the function checks for <code>nullptr</code> internally, then that is just pointless since <code>this</code> is <em>not</em> allowed to ever be <code>nullptr</code> inside a member function, so any sensible optimizing compiler is just going to optimize away any such check.</p>
<p>What you want in your current situation is probably <code>if (ActorPtr &amp;&amp; ActorPtr-&gt;IsValidLowLevel())</code>.</p>

Anyways, after a few seconds, the Packaging Fails and all the Output Log shows as an error is: <em>PackagingResults: Error: Unknown Error</em>. Well now that ain't exactly too specific, is it? Oh yeah, I should probably specify that the Project uses <em>Metahumans</em>, and therefore the Metahuman Plugin.</p>

<li><p>Changing the Project Icon to an Older Exported Game's Icon</p>

When I switched to that, the pakcaging failed again. I switch back to the other game's icon, that originally worked, but this time that failed too!</p>
<p>NOTE: My SSD doesn't have much free space and the Unreal Editor sends warnings about low space whenever I open it. But I don't think that's what causes the issue, because when I tried to package the previous game, I didn't get an issue.</p>

76466179,Create pose asset that matches a particular animation frame - UE5.1,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76466179/create-pose-asset-that-matches-a-particular-animation-frame-ue5-1,1,1686667824,unreal-engine5,"<p>In an <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/76466078/467386"">earlier</a> question I'm looking for a workflow to fix bad animation retargeting in-context, but here's a more specific question relating to Poses in Unreal Engine 5.1.</p>
<p>I'm trying to &quot;freeze&quot; an animation at a specific frame and capture a POSE asset from that exact frame, so I can later use that pose asset in my retargeting workflow.</p>
<p>There is a tutorial that's easily found that shows how to capture a single-frame animation, and there are also ways to bake a static mesh from an animation frame, but I want to create a pose asset from an animation frame.</p>
<p>It seems obvious - you scrub an animation to the frame you want and then choose &quot;Create Pose Asset&quot; from Current Animation, but that just results in another perfect A-Pose, not a pose based on the current frame of the animation.</p>
<p>Is it just not possible (and why the heck not). Or am I missing the point of Poses altogether?</p>
","<p>Okay this is a bit of a weird one but the solution appears simple enough. Once you have created the pose asset from an animation frame by scrubbing to that frame and choosing Create &gt; Pose Asset &gt; From Current Pose, you have to edit the pose asset and find the Weight slider and set it to 1.0 and then re-save the asset.</p>
<p>I have no idea why this last step is necessary, but it seems to work. Then you can re-import the pose asset into your retargeter and make it a retarget pose.</p>

Why does client not spawn all decals when server does?,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78469337/unreliable-repnotify-behaviour-in-unreal-engine-5-3-2-why-does-client-not-spawn,-1,1715549209,"network-programming, game-development, replication, unreal-engine5, unreal-blueprint","<p>Im trying to spawn a decal actor at the hit location of a players hitscan weapon (linetrace). For simplification I have set up the part of the code that produces the issue in a new project using the first person template.</p>
<p>Here is all the blueprints that I have added to achieve the goal of spawning the decal, the rest of the project is purely template code. <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/cqaIJdgY.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/cqaIJdgY.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>SpawnDecal is set to Not Replicate.</p>
<p>When testing in the Play in editor setup as listen server with one client, the listen server spawns all decals without issue (seen on the right) while the client does not reliably spawn all decals, seen on the left. <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/JfSOn12C.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/JfSOn12C.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>Why could this be happening? Shouldnt the play in editor setup assume a perfect server and connection with infinite bandwidth, no loss and no ping unless network simulation is enabled (which it is not in this case)? In that case I dont see how the client could ever miss spawning a decal with this code while testing with Play in editor.</p>
","<p>So it seems that the issue here is that either the listening server is able to process the next frame and replicate the new data before the recieving client is able to  use the data from the previous frame, overwirting it. Another possible reason could be that the data for the previous frame sometimes arrives later than the data for the current frame due to UDP stuff and is therefore discarded or that the value is updated before the server can replicate it.</p>
<p>I've found two possible solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Store all recieved data in a queue and have the client work through it on its own pace instead of using one constantly changing variable.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use a ForceNetUpdate node after setting the replicated variable to ensure the value is replicated successfully before its overwriten and resent.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I went with option 2 and it works nicely without any noticable performance impacts. However I an not certain that if using ForceNetUpdate nodes frequently is a good idea and i'd lean on trying to avoid it if I encounter the same issue again.</p>

78490123,Using lambdas and templates with macros in C++,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78490123/using-lambdas-and-templates-with-macros-in-c,0,1715865032,"c++, unreal-engine5","<p>I'm wrapping a collection of boiler plated Async code snippets to learn more about macros &amp; templating in Unreal Engine 5.3, C++ 17. Unfortunately my C++ capabilities are quite limited and just don't understand enough about the complexities of using templates and macros together. (The below example is only a 1 liner, but for more complex implementations should I even be using macros..?)</p>
<p>From what I can see i would only need to include the type declaration when calling the <code>BlockingTask</code> method but don't know how to pass that information through a macro.</p>
<p>How should I handle the macro/template syntax in order to fix the erroring lambda version?</p>

    //Preferred syntax, Argument Error: lambda[]() -&gt; FString

    FString strA1 = ASYNC_BLOCKING_TASK_A([&amp;]() { return Async_TestB(); });
    FString strA2 = ASYNC_BLOCKING_TASK_B([&amp;]() { return Async_TestB(); });


    /* The rest all Work */

    //Verifying the template works when passing the type
    FString strB = ::Async::BlockingTask&lt;FString&gt;([&amp;]() { return Async_TestB(); });

    //The macro works when passing the method as a variable.
    //I'd prefer to not have to manually declare the task though.
    TFunction&lt;FString()&gt; task_B = [this]() { return this-&gt;Async_TestB(); };
    FString strC = ASYNC_BLOCKING_TASK_B(task_B);
    FString strD = ::Async::BlockingTask(task_B);

}
</code></pre>
<p>Macros.h</p>
<pre><code>#define ASYNC_BLOCKING_TASK_A(method) \
{ \
    ::Async::BlockingTask(method); \
}
#define ASYNC_BLOCKING_TASK_B(method) \

        TFuture&lt;T&gt; result = AsyncThread(method);
        return result.Get();
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Please ignore the terrible concept of a task that blocks the calling thread. I started by templating the most basic implementation to reduce complexity while learning. I have 'good' implementations that support cancellation tokens and completion callbacks that i plan to create templated macros for once I understand how to do it correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Edit1:</strong>
I didn't include the actual error text... my apologies, added now as comment above erroring line.</p>
<p>I've learnt that the <code>{}'s</code> in the ASYNC_BLOCKING_TASK_A macro aren't part of the syntax and were my misunderstanding of the reference I was using to learn. However ASYNC_BLOCKING_TASK_B without the extra <code>{}'s</code> suffers from the same error with my use of the lambdas.</p>

<p>Technically I'm calling them sockets and knobs. Sockets, like on the left larger cube, have an array of what knobs can attach, the local position, and the local rotation (in Euler angles). The knobs have a type (to check if they can attach), a local position and local rotation same as the sockets.</p>
<p>Assuming I've already determined which knob and which socket I want to 'attach', how do I calculate that rotation of the smaller cube from the diagram? The rotation of these objects in the world can be anything, and the euler angles, though likely to be clean 90-degree angles, could also be anything.</p>

","<p>The base64 in question is the result of encoding a Guid in its binary format, not in the original string format.</p>
<p>A Guid in binary format consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>4-byte integer</li>
<li>2-byte integer</li>
<li>2-byte integer</li>
<li>8-byte array</li>
</ul>
<p>It does not consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>4-byte integer</li>
<li>2-byte integer</li>
<li>2-byte integer</li>
<li>2-byte integer</li>
<li>6-byte array</li>
</ul>
<p>As depicted in the string format.</p>
<p>Your C++ code is base64-encoding an array of four 4-byte integers (because that is how <code>FGuid</code> stores them - I do not know why), which is not the same Guid format that C# and Javascript are using. You need to make sure you are using the correct number of integers, as well as correct byte size and endian for them, to match what C# and Javascript are using.</p>
<p><sup>IIRC, Javascript uses Big-Endian integers, and C# uses Big- or Little-Endian integers depending on the system (see <code>BitConverter.IsLittleEndian</code>).</sup></p>
<p><code>5rNzP1Fzb0Gso65jmj9Yfw</code> decodes as bytes:</p>
<p><code>e6 b3 73 3f 51 73 6f 41 ac a3 ae 63 9a 3f 58 7f</code></p>
<p>Which is the following Guid values in binary format:</p>
<p><code>e6 b3 73 3f</code> = 0x3F73B3E6<br />
<code>51 73</code>       = 0x7351<br />
<code>6f 41</code>       = 0x416F<br />
<code>ac a3 ae 63 9a 3f 58 7f</code></p>
<p>So, you need something <em>equivalent</em> to the following in your C++ code:</p>
<pre><code>uint8 Bytes[16];
memcpy(Bytes+0,  &amp;myGuid.A, 4);
memcpy(Bytes+4,  &amp;myGuid.B, 4);
memcpy(Bytes+8,  &amp;myGuid.C, 4);
memcpy(Bytes+12, &amp;myGuid.D, 4);

uint32 *ptr1 = reinterpret_cast&lt;uint32*&gt;(Bytes+0);
uint16 *ptr2 = reinterpret_cast&lt;uint16*&gt;(Bytes+4);
uint16 *ptr3 = reinterpret_cast&lt;uint16*&gt;(Bytes+2);

*ptr1 = NETWORK_ORDER32(*ptr1);
*ptr2 = NETWORK_ORDER16(*ptr2);
*ptr3 = NETWORK_ORDER16(*ptr3);
// not sure if FGuid stores the remaining
// 8 bytes in the correct order or not. If
// not, swap them around here as needed...

TCHAR Buffer[25];
int32 Len = FBase64::Encode(Bytes, sizeof(Bytes), Buffer);

<p>A UFunction is a C++ function that is recognized by the Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) reflection system. Any <code>UObject</code> or Blueprint function library can declare a member function as a UFunction by placing the <code>UFUNCTION</code> macro on the line above the function declaration in the header file.

","<p><strong>ISSUE SOLVED!</strong></p>
<p>The bug is located in the <code>Read</code> function in the <code>SQLiteEmbeddedPlatform.cpp</code> of the <code>UE SQLiteCore Plugin</code> by calling the <a href=""https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/f7e9b48a637e7b49e89992041620f89d964c9fa1/Engine/Source/Runtime/Core/Private/HoloLens/HoloLensPlatformFile.cpp#L122"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Seek()</a> function in <code>HoloLensPlatformFile.cpp</code> when building for <code>Microsoft HoloLens platform</code>. Diving into the <code>Seek()</code> function of the <code>FileHandle</code> implementation for <code>Microsoft HoloLens Platform</code>, the error occurs in the <code>FileSeek()</code> function which calls the function <code>SetFilePointerEx()</code> from the <code>Windows SDK 10.0.18362.0</code> located at <code>Windows Kits\10\Include\10.0.18362.0\um\fileapi.h</code>. For some unknown reason, the function returns false. The corresponding <a href=""https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/f7e9b48a637e7b49e89992041620f89d964c9fa1/Engine/Source/Runtime/Core/Private/Windows/WindowsPlatformFile.cpp#L638"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Seek()</a> function in <code>WindowsPlatformFile.cpp</code> for the <code>Windows platform</code> does not check the return value and always returns true.</p>
<p>The issue could be solved through building the SQLite library from source by a custom integrated Unreal Plugin named <code>SQLiteZ</code>. The source code for the SQLite library (sqlite3.h, sqlite3.c) is used from <a href=""https://www.sqlite.org/2024/sqlite-amalgamation-3450200.zip"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SQLite amalgamation</a>.</p>
<p>To use the library in the UE Plugin, in the <code>SQLiteZ.Build.cs</code> file, the appropriated preprocessor statements must be properly set to build the SQLite library for <code>Unreal UWP</code> to use on <code>Microsoft HoloLense 2</code>.

<p>As the comment says in the code block above, <code>MyProperty-&gt;GetPtr()-&gt;GetValue()</code> returns the correct value in <code>BeginPlay</code> when its called after initializing <code>MyProperty</code></p>
<p>I exposed <code>MyProperty-&gt;GetPtr()-&gt;GetValue()</code> to blueprints to call it at <code>BP_BeginPlay</code>, Again, I get the correct value which is nice</p>
<p>However, After one or more frames <code>MyProperty-&gt;GetPtr()-&gt;GetValue()</code> no longer returns the correct value for some reason, Used a delay node in BP with value of 0.0 to skip a frame</p>
<p>After hours of debugging, Stripping down the code to the version above, and pulling my hair out I decided to look at memory addresses, It turns out the address which <code>MyClass::Value</code> points to is not the same after one frame of initializing <code>MyProperty</code></p>
<p>This is how I got the address <code>UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT(&quot;Address[%p]&quot;), *ThePointer);</code></p>
<p>I honestly don't know what to search for online, Memory stuff is beyond me, But I did try and failed</p>
<p>Any help is greatly appreciated, Thanks!</p>
","<p><code>FMyStruct</code> was being copied and destroyed multiple times for reasons I do not know, So I overrode <code>=</code> operator and updated the properties with the new struct, Especially the pointer that points to the struct value</p>

{
    Value = Other.Value;
    NewClass = Other.NewClass;
    if (NewClass.IsValid())
    {
        NewClass-&gt;Value = &amp;Value; // I made it public for testing purposes
    }
    return *this;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is a walkaround code and is probably bad, And I think having to do this defeats the purpose of my original code, which is having only 1 true struct, I think I may have to reconsider my design</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>:</p>
<p>After reading more I came up with this code</p>
<pre><code>FMyStruct&amp; operator=(const FMyStruct&amp; Other) // Couldn't compile without this
{
    if (&amp;Other == this) return *this;
    NewClass = Other.NewClass;
    return *this;
}

FMyStruct&amp; operator=(FMyStruct&amp;&amp; Other)
{
    Value = Other.Value;
    NewClass = Other.NewClass;
    if (NewClass.IsValid())

    return *this;

<p>What happens at <code>MyProperty = FMyStruct(100.0f);</code> in <code>BeginPlay</code> of <code>UMyObject</code> If I understand correctly is it calls default ctor for lValue, Custom ctor for rValue, and then <code>FMyStruct&amp; operator=(FMyStruct&amp;&amp; Other)</code> in lValue with rValue as the parameter, Please correct me if I'm wrong!</p>

<p>First, I tried debugging it: it gets inside the if statement, but not inside the <code>GameHasEnded  </code>   function.
Secondly, I searched for <code>GameHasEnded</code> and found that I should call <code>getdefaultpawnclassforcontroller</code> and override it by replacing it with virtual, but this is not what I wanted because it is Read-Only and returns a Pawn.
Third, I checked to make sure that the Blueprint specified in the <code>GameMode</code>, <code>WorldSetting</code>, and <code>ProjectSettings</code> was entered. I confirmed that it was, and that it was correctly entered.
The fourth thing I checked is the most suspicious, I changed the '<code>PlayerControllerClass</code>' in '<code>GameMode</code>' to '<code>BP_ShooterPlayerController</code>', but when I run it, it spawns a '<code>PlayearController</code>'.
I googled '<code>getdefaultpawnclassforcontroller</code>' but it didn't work, so this is in line with the second point.</p>

78280636,Unable to Register Vertex Shader in Unreal Engine with C++,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78280636/unable-to-register-vertex-shader-in-unreal-engine-with-c,0,1712327829,"c++, compiler-errors, shader, vertex-shader, unreal-engine5","<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>I am currently trying to create a vertex shader in Unreal Engine. The project does build, however the Editor crashes while attempting to retrieve my shader file. I acquire the error message in the log <code>Couldn't find source file of virtual shader path '/Engine/Shaders/Private/DemoShader.usf'</code>. Despite constant research, I have yet to fix this issue.</p>
<h1>Shader Module</h1>
<p>In order to include shaders in my project, I have created a game module named <code>ShadersModule</code>, which is implemented in my ShadersModule CPP file. All code shown, with exception to the DemoShader USF file, is contained within <code>ShadersModule</code>. This module includes <code>RenderCore</code> as a public dependency. Additionally, the primary game module includes <code>ShadersModule</code> as a public dependency. Due to when shaders need to be loaded, <code>ShadersModule</code>’s loading phase is set to <code>PostConfigInit</code> in my uproject file.</p>
<h1>Shader Registration (Face Value Problem)</h1>
<p>So far, I think it is likely that my implementation of the <code>IMPLEMENT_SHADER_TYPE</code> macro is failing to register my vertex shader. This is due to the crash log stating <code>Couldn't find source file of virtual shader path '/Engine/Shaders/Private/DemoShader.usf'</code>. Various references I have found use different virtual paths to my own, however none of them appear to have worked for me so far. I have been led to believe that the intended virtual path has changed across Unreal Engine versions, which might be my issue. Most references I have found use various Unreal Engine 4 versions. I am using Unreal Engine v5.1.1 with a C++ project. I attempt to register the shader in my DemoShaderVS CPP file with the following line:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>IMPLEMENT_SHADER_TYPE(, FDemoShaderVS, TEXT(&quot;/Engine/Shaders/Private/DemoShader.usf&quot;), TEXT(&quot;MainVS&quot;), SF_Vertex);
</code></pre>
<h1>Shader Directory Mapping</h1>
<h2>Project Shader Path</h2>
<p>I have created a directory to locate my shader file within my project at <code>/Shaders</code>. Within this, I have created two subdirectories, <code>Private</code> &amp; <code>Public</code>. I have been made aware these distinctions are necessary, however I feel unsure as to whether this is strictly the case. Regardless, my shader is in the <code>Private</code> folder.</p>
<h2>Virtual Shader Path</h2>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<p>I have mapped my project’s shader directory to Unreal Engine’s virtual shader directory in my ShadersModule header file. This was done by creating a subclass of <code>IModuleInterface</code>, which in my case is named <code>FShaderModule</code>. I have overriden the <code>StartupModule()</code> function &amp; I execute <code>AddShaderSourceDirectoryMapping()</code> in order to map my path.</p>
<h3>Errors</h3>
<p>My previous mappings used to throw errors when I started the Editor, however I believe this has ceased with the use of the <code>/Engine/Shaders/Private</code> path. When this used to present an error, the crash log suggested I use the aforementioned path. However, I have found this to be particularly confusing. Despite requiring a virtual path, the aforementioned path is a real path within my Engine directory. I am also wondering if the paths are correct, but if they are not being mapped prior to the Engine attempting to retrieve my shader. If this is the case, I don’t know why this would be. Regardless, I currently map the directories as follows:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>FString shaderDirectory = FPaths::Combine(FPaths::ProjectDir(), TEXT(&quot;Shaders/Private&quot;));
AddShaderSourceDirectoryMapping(&quot;/Engine/Shaders/Private&quot;, shaderDirectory);
</code></pre>
<h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>The rest of my code that I felt is worth sharing is below. I have also included more of the crash log. Any help would be extremely appreciated.^^</p>

78224643,UE5 Manual actor/world physics simulation tick,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78224643/ue5-manual-actor-world-physics-simulation-tick,1,1711449570,"multiplayer, unreal-engine5, unreal","<p>I’m prototyping a custom multiplayer system with a mesh of game servers, a replication server (only handles data) and state interpolation for the clients. Currently using UE 5.3 built from source.</p>
<p>I would like to use the built-in systems (apart from the networking, as I wrote a custom system myself) as much as I can, so think its physics system, character movement component and the chaos vehicles for example. While I do think that for a core system like networking it would be good to actually integrate it into the engine source, it would be way out of scope for a prototype and would make updating to new UE versions harder.
So far things are working great as far as the custom server mesh logic goes (data replication, authority transfer, client/server side entity streaming etc). We've been able to play pretty smoothly on hosted infra during tests.</p>
<p>Where I’m running into issues, is when a player changes their input on an actor that they control. Let’s use a vehicle as an example.
Imagine they’re driving along in their vehicle and now begin to apply steering input to the left. The server has already simulated a few updates ahead and transmitted these to the client (so that we have some data buffered in case of high latency for the client) and in order to have a buffer on the replication server (that would be correct if nothing changes in the object’s trajectory/state). These buffered updates are now incorrect both on the servers and on the client because of the input change, so in this situation we’d like to re-simulate the out of date updates on the server and push those to the client, using the new state values. So in my head that would be placing the actor back at the point where the input state changed, set the new state values and then advance the physics simulation forward by the required amount of steps/deltatime.
Because vehicles are not a simple 'move in direction X with chosen velocity X and check collision' entity (having properties like engine/wheel speed, wheel grip etc etc) I think I need to rely on the physics system to calculate the simulation result.</p>
<p><strong>Now, the question;</strong></p>
<p><em>How can we manually simulate one or more physics ticks for an actor?</em>
I haven’t been able to find any way to execute manual physics updates for an actor using the built-in physics system. While I did stumble across some similar posts online, everything I could find was either very old (pre-UE5) or had no resolution.</p>
<p>If manually simulating a single actor isn’t possible, perhaps is there a way to simulate a copy of the entire physics world / a subset of relevant actors that I put into a separate physics world? In that case maybe I can have the server re-simulate that and pull the updated data from there.</p>
<p>What I've tried so far is looking through documentation, UE source code and trying things like manually executing engine main tick functions (which is actually not recommended as far as I know).</p>
<p>Any input would be appreciated. I’ve been messing around with this for so long that I may have ended up with tunnel vision, so outside input could be refreshing.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time!</p>

<p>Here is the video of how geometry dash works:</p>
<p>https://youtu.be/mCapH4nfhzY</p>
<p>For example, I tried setting material from level BP, but the BP requires an object reference, ex &quot;cube &gt; get material&quot;. However in the level BP it does not allow for that. Is there a way I can get get a reference to objects of that material? (P.S, I know that you can just change the properties of the material by itself, but I specifically want to change all objects with a certain &quot;group id&quot;, like scaling all objects by (2,2,2) if it has this ID.</p>

The goal is simple. I want to be able to display a cube. I want to specify vertices, faces and normals by hand. Hardcode it in C++, create mesh and display. And yet I can’t get it right.</p>
<p>Full code of the project is available in this repo. Please look at the AMyActor::RegenerateMeshByHand method.

<p>I have a bare bones project with just a single MyActor deriving from the AActor. I create a UDynamicMeshComponent and set it as my root component.
In PostLoad() I attempt to create a UE::Geometry::FDynamicMesh3 mesh and set it in my root component.</p>
<p>It all works, the mesh is set, but it doesn’t look good. Every other face has a messed up normal and because of that half of the faces of the cube are invisible. They are visible only “from inside”, because only in this view, the normals are facing camera (I think).</p>

<p>I tried another thing: create a cube in Blender, export to OBJ file, look what’s inside and do the same from the code. AND IT WORKS (after ReverseOrientation and InitializeOverlayToPerTriangleNormals)!! Full cube is displayed, all the normals are fine.
So, I’m double-confused.</p>

","<p>I got the same error in Visual Studio, then I decided to switch to Rider and it told that build is failing because Live Coding console is launched (though I didn't have UE opened). Then I restarted my computer to kill live console and managed to build.</p>

78118514,Mysterious UI Stacking behavior when creating drop down menus using SComboButton within Slate UI C++,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/78118514/mysterious-ui-stacking-behavior-when-creating-drop-down-menus-using-scombobutton,1,1709780021,unreal-engine5,"<p>I'm attempting to create a custom SCompoundWidget which will act as an easy to use drop down menu within Slate UI. I'm doing this in c++.</p>
<p>As it stands, the project compiles and runs. It shows the drop down menu normally enough at first. The issue is that when I click one of the options displayed within the drop down menu, it appears to create a new drop down and stack it on top of the old.</p>
<p>For example, suppose I have the following items within my drop down:</p>
<pre><code>Example
Test
p1
</code></pre>
<p>The drop down will open with Example as it is the first and default item within the list. The drop down menu appears with AutoWidth() so it is only as wide as it needs to be. Notice how 'Example' is the longest (width wise) item within our drop down menu.</p>
<p>If I then click the drop down, the menu will appear as normal.</p>
<p>Once I select one of the options, say 'Test', it looks like a new drop down menu appears stacked on top of the previous menu. It appears stacked because the width of this new menu is shorter as 'Test' is shorter width-wise than 'Example'.</p>
<p>I cannot interact with the previous menu, and in fact, when using the Unreal Engine 'Widget Inspector' tool, there is truly only one SComboButton on my widget even though two seem to be there.</p>
<p>The same is true if I then open the drop down and select 'p1' which is shorter than 'Test'. Now it appears that there are three drop down menus stacked on top of each other.</p>

<p>When using the old Unreal Engine input system as shown in <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/U8Cjr.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2</a> everything works as expected. However using the new Unreal Engine EnhancedInputAction which we are using in our project I run into some problems. From research it seems that the corresponding pins to the previous &quot;Pressed&quot; and &quot;Released&quot; pins are now &quot;Triggered&quot; and &quot;Completed&quot;.</p>

<p>This does not happen with the old input system but does with the new. Does anyone know why this might be the case? I have the idea that the &quot;Triggered&quot;, which runs every frame manages to get multiple inputs through to the server before it sets the isFiring bool to true but thats only speculation as I would assume the setting of the boolean shouldnt take more than a single tick. And in this case why doesnt it happen with the old &quot;Pressed&quot; pin?</p>
<p>Edit:</p>

<p>Changing the input to be consumed also does not fix the issue.</p>
","<p>What you want is the <code>Started</code> execution pin which will only fire once assuming your <code>InputAction</code> Trigger (in your <code>InputMappingContext</code>) is <code>Down</code> and not <code>Pulse</code></p>

<p>I also tried retarget the solution to the sdk compatible with my operating system (windows 11). I also tried deleting folders and directories in the root project folder to &quot;generate visual studio project files&quot; by right clicking on the unreal engine project file -&gt; show more options -&gt; Generate visual studio project files. I'll also share all the components I have installed via the visual studio installer if that helps <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/AAudo.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Installed components in visual studio</a></p>
<p>Help is super appreciated. If any more information is needed I'll provide it right away when asked. Thank you.</p>
","<p>I think you're missing the step to update your <code>&lt;ProjectName&gt;.Build.cs</code> with the dependencies on the UMG modules.</p>
<p>From <a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/ProgrammingWithCPP/CPPTutorials/UMG/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/ProgrammingWithCPP/CPPTutorials/UMG/</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In HowTo_UMG.Build.CS, we need to add UMG to the list of included public modules, and Slate and SlateCore to the list of included private modules. We'll need to modify the first line in HowTo_UMG's constructor to read as follows:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { &quot;Core&quot;, &quot;CoreUObject&quot;, &quot;Engine&quot;, &quot;InputCore&quot;, &quot;UMG&quot; });
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>And then we can uncomment the following line:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>PrivateDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { &quot;Slate&quot;, &quot;SlateCore&quot; });
</code></pre>
<p>In general when you hit an &quot;unresolved external symbol&quot; error when building a UE project and the error mentions an Unreal Engine C++ class (e.g. UWidget in this case) it means you're missing the right dependencies in your <code>&lt;ProjectName&gt;.Build.cs</code> file.</p>

<p>However, I want the client to try connecting at the start for a little while (3 tries with a ten second interval) and when the client already had established a connection and the server disappears, I would like for the client to indefinitely try reconnecting until the server is back again.

            Disconnect(true);

        return;
    }

    Debug::Log(std::format(&quot;Connected to Solid at {0}:{1}&quot;, _endpoint.address().to_string(), _endpoint.port()));

    for (; !_outMessageQueue.empty(); _outMessageQueue.pop()) {
        SendMessage(_outMessageQueue.front());
    }

    //start receive
    ReceiveData();
}

void IOSocket::Disconnect(bool tryReconnect, int remainingAttempts) {

        _waitForReconnect = Utilities::Delay(10000, [this](int n) { Connect(n); }, remainingAttempts);

<p>This <em>nearly</em> works. I get a connection and I can send messages, but I don't receive anything. If I debug and set a breakpoint in any delayed function, the io_context is &quot;stopped&quot; and &quot;outstanding_work&quot; is 0. Even if I restart it and give it new &quot;fake&quot; work to do, I still don't get it process incomming messages.
If I make the innitial connection attempt synchronously (and the server is running), this still produces a functioning connection, but reconnects don't, and if I make the innitial attempt asynchronously, it shows the same behaviour as the reconnects. There is no difference between calling it through my Delay function, an explicit std::thread or a manual std::async call.</p>
<p>I am quite new to asio and I haven't written C++ code in nearly a decade (I am usually using C#), so I am sure there is a lot I am doing wrong, but I just can't figure out what it is.</p>

I haven't used SVN for over a decade, only Perforce and Git.
My understanding is that one of the pitfalls with SVN is that without careful communication it is very easy for users to 'clobber' each other's work since by default source repo files aren't locked when checking out to make changes.</p>
<p>Is there some way, via Tortoise or the cmd line to easily lock server files when checked out for modifications so they cannot be overwritten?</p>
","<p>Your understanding is only partly correct. For anything that can be merged (i.e. textual data like source code), Subversion goes out of its way to prevent clobbering. For files that cannot be merged (i.e. binary files) you can force users to lock them before they work on them.</p>
<p>In general, Subversion will refuse to commit if there's a more recent revision of a modified file in the repository. In this case, Subversion requires you to</p>
<ul>
<li>update first</li>
<li>merge and resolve conflicts (if any) locally</li>
<li>finally commit a clean version</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a simplified version of Subversion's <a href=""https://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.tour.cycle.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">basic work cycle</a>, especially of the item <a href=""https://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.tour.cycle.html#svn.tour.cycle.resolve"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Resolve any conflicts</a>.</p>
<p>Let's see what this means for data that can be merged and for data that cannot be merged.</p>
<h3>Files that can be merged (source code)</h3>
<p>While it's not entirely impossible to clobber your teammates' work, you would need to actively discard or overwrite their changes. While mistakes do happen, Subversion is inherently not more error prone than Git or Perforce.</p>
<p>Locking all source code files by default would put an unnecessary restriction on the team.</p>
<h3>Files that cannot be merged (binary files)</h3>
<p>With binaries (you mention Unreal so I guess you'll deal with image files and 3D models), there's the problem that they cannot be merged. If a conflict happens, you're left with a decision to use <em>yours</em> or <em>theirs</em> and nothing in between.</p>
<p>To be clear about it, this would still be a conscious decision a user has to make before committing the conflicting change. Even if such a collision happens, it cannot go unnoticed.</p>
<p>To prevent this case, you may choose to put the <code>svn:needs-lock</code> property on those files as explained in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/569948/force-user-to-lock-file-in-svn-before-editing"">Force user to lock file in SVN before editing</a></p>
<hr />
<p>In both cases, there's no guarantee somebody will not decide to be overly clever or just throw out a teammate's &quot;inferior&quot; work. The potential to disregard or misuse the system is there and no tool will be able to prevent it.</p>
<p>There's also a good <a href=""https://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.basic.version-control-basics.html#svn.basic.vsn-models.lock-unlock"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">explanation of locking models</a> in the already cited Red Bean book.</p>
<p>If anything happens, you can always <em>reverse-merge</em> your changes to the last good state as explained in <a href=""https://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.8/svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.html#svn.branchmerge.basicmerging.undo"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Undoing changes</a> or right here on SO: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1930725/svn-reverse-merge"">SVN reverse merge?</a></p>
<h3>Comparison with Perforce and Git</h3>
<p>The problem of concurrent editing of binary files is present in Git as well. IMHO, Subversion's centralized nature makes it far easier and safer to use than Git. On the other hand, Git being distributed is a primary reason for its ubiquity and success.</p>
<p>I possess only superfluous knowledge of Perforce so the following may be off. From what I recall, concurrent editing is not possible at all. Opening a file to write will lock it for all other members of the team. This behaves like Subversion with locking on by default.</p>

<p>I know that in order to draw in Unreal, you have to use Render Target.</p>
<p>However, as shown in the video above, there were only several materials for drawing on the whiteboard that existed as a 3D mesh actor, and there were no materials dealing with how to draw on the 2D UI screen like me.</p>
<p>Drawing on the whiteboard seems to be using 'line tracing', shooting laser and using 'casting' function. So I thought it was difficult to use that method to draw images of UI. (If you can use it as it is, I would appreciate some more advice in the comments.)</p>
<p>In addition, even if we found similar data, most of them were from 2014-2017, so it was difficult to apply them to current Unreal. (For example, Unreal officially recommends using Draw Material to Render Target, but we used Begin/End Draw Canvas to Render Target for all previous data.)</p>
<p>Currently, the materials I found on the internet are not using canvas render targets, only render targets. I want to use canvas render targets because my goal is to draw on the UI screen, but I couldn't find any information related to this.</p>

<p>This script works great and allow me to pass through cursor movements and mouse clicks that work with all windows applications EXCEPT my application. The cursor moves, but when my application is in focus, the clicks do absolutely nothing in the application.</p>
<p>Is it possible that my application written in Unreal Engine natively ignores &quot;virtual&quot; mouse events and requires that they originate from a HID driver? And if so, are there easy configuration settings that would allow for emulated mouse events?</p>
<p>The win32 commands work fine with just about eveyr other application, and my custom Unreal application works fine with a direct hardware mouse, so it really only seems to be this combination of emulated mouse clicks and my custom application causing issues.</p>

<p>Anyway I have 2 blueprints, 1 that is going to be a checkpoint for my racetrack and I created a boolean within this called Is Finish Line and I need to reference that in my other blueprint: GM_RacingGame where all my gamemode settings are. This is what I have:</p>

<p>So far I notice I can only see the choice when context sensitive is off. Why is this and how do I fix it?</p>
","<p>The issue lies in the type that the ForEach-loop reports on its return-value. It says that the &quot;Array Element&quot; is of type &quot;Actor Object&quot;, which is a base-class of your BP Checkpoint Object. Obviously, this does not have the &quot;Is Finish Line&quot; variable, so that's why the context sensitive menu (and the attempt at connection fails).</p>
<p>In general, Unreal is strongly typed, so if you have a &quot;Actor Object&quot;, and want to get a &quot;BP Checkpoint Object&quot;, you would have to cast down (with the cast node). However, please hold on to it for now, as there is one other possible explanation in your example.</p>
<p>See, GetAllActorsOfClass should actually return an array of the correct type. Meaning if you connect a ForEachLoop, the &quot;Array Element&quot; should be BP Checkpoint. I think what might have happened is that you created the ForEach-loop before, and had another array connected (or possibly the GetAllActorsOfClass-node without a selected class). This would cause the ForEach-loop to select the wrong type for its return-value, and unfortunately wildcard-nodes in Unreal (which ForEach is), won't refresh their types to match up automatically. Try one of two things</p>
<ol>
<li>Force-refreshing the ForEach-Loop node, via Right-click context menu on it</li>
<li>If that doesn't help, create a new ForEach-Loop, and connect it directly to your GetAllActorsOfClass</li>
</ol>
<p>Then it should work as intended.</p>

","<p>Normal matrix is the transpose of the inverse of the rotation part of the transformation matrix. It seems like you are doing it on the transformation matrix which also has the position.</p>
<p>Technically, you only need to invert the rotation matrix because the normal vectors are all directional and thus unit vectors. The reason we use the transpose of the inverse of the rotation part is just to get rid of any scale.

","<p>Short answer is that you cannot. Unreal Engine does not provide this capability in the Editor itself.</p>
<p>However, you can easily work around this by placing your Actor in a level, hitting play, and then making modifications to the animation. PIE (Play In Editor) <em>does</em> support hot-reload of Animations and Animation Blueprints so you can preview your animation changes in-game in real-time with animation sequences and compile (while game is running) for the Animation Blueprint.</p>

77759308,Unreal Engine 5 can&#39;t find TStaticArray,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77759308/unreal-engine-5-cant-find-tstaticarray,4,1704381339,"c++, unreal-engine5","<p>My problem revolves around a data asset class describing a survivor for my game. The class contains an <code>FText</code> for both the name and description and it compiled fine. However, after I added a property for teachable perks, which every survivor has 3 of, it started causing issues.
At first, I thought I just forgot to include the necessary header, that being <code>&quot;Containers/StaticArray.h&quot;</code>, but even after that I still get an error telling me that <em>&quot;a class, delegate, enum, or struct, with the name TStaticArray can not be found&quot;</em>. I know that I have the correct header because I checked the documentation for the <a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/API/Runtime/Core/Containers/TStaticArray/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TStaticArray</a> type so I'm stuck. It might be worth noting that intellisense does show the correct type, I can even navigate to the definition by holding down control and left-clicking on it in Visual Studio, but the compiler doesn't seem to find it.</p>
<p>Any help is much appreciated.</p>
<p>Here's the full code:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>#pragma once

#include &quot;CoreMinimal.h&quot;
#include &quot;Engine/DataAsset.h&quot;
#include &quot;Containers/StaticArray.h&quot;
#include &quot;SurvivorData.generated.h&quot;

UCLASS()
class KILLERGAME_API USurvivorData : public UPrimaryDataAsset
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
    
public:
    UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, EditDefaultsOnly)
    FText Name;

    UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, EditDefaultsOnly)
    FText Description;

    UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, EditDefaultsOnly)
    TStaticArray&lt;TObjectPtr&lt;class UPerkData&gt;, 3&gt; TeachablePerks;
};
</code></pre>
<p><code>UPerkData</code> is just another data asset describing a perk.</p>
<p>Tools used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Visual Studio 2022 17.8.3</li>
<li>Unreal Engine 5.3</li>
</ul>
","<p>So I think I've figured it out.</p>
<p>I had the correct header file and the template type doesn't matter. <code>TStaticArray</code> simply doesn't work as a <code>UPROPERTY</code>. Using it as a normal field works fine.</p>
<p>So that answers that.</p>
<p>No to my workaround to achieve the limiting of the array length to 3.
I had to fall back to old faithful and use a simple <code>TArray</code>. I only care about limiting its size in the editor since it is a data asset. So I added a constructor that initializes the array with 3 empty slots, added <code>EditFixedSize</code> to the metadata, and overwrote the const version of the <code>IsDataValid</code> method derived from <code>UObject</code>. In it, I simply define the object as invalid should the array size not equal 3.</p>
<p>Here's the code:</p>
<p>Header:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>#pragma once

#include &quot;CoreMinimal.h&quot;
#include &quot;Engine/DataAsset.h&quot;
#include &quot;PerkData.h&quot;
#include &quot;SurvivorData.generated.h&quot;

UCLASS()
class KILLERGAME_API USurvivorData : public UPrimaryDataAsset
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
    
public:
    UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, EditDefaultsOnly)
    FText Name;

    UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, EditDefaultsOnly)
    FText Description;

    UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, EditDefaultsOnly, EditFixedSize)
    TArray&lt;UPerkData*&gt; TeachablePerks;

    USurvivorData();

    virtual EDataValidationResult IsDataValid(FDataValidationContext&amp; Context) const override;
};
</code></pre>
<p>CPP:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>#include &quot;SurvivorData.h&quot;
#include &quot;Misc/DataValidation.h&quot;

USurvivorData::USurvivorData()
    : TeachablePerks({ nullptr, nullptr, nullptr })
{ }

EDataValidationResult USurvivorData::IsDataValid(FDataValidationContext&amp; Context) const
{
    if (TeachablePerks.Num() != 3)
    {
        Context.AddError(FText::FromString(TEXT(&quot;Number of teachable perks can only be 3!&quot;)));
        return EDataValidationResult::Invalid;
    }

    return EDataValidationResult::Valid;
}
</code></pre>
<p>For anyone curious, I'd encourage them to read the official documentation about data validation <a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/data-validation-in-unreal-engine/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>
<p>So that wraps it up. <code>TStaticArray</code> is great for use as a private field or as a variable in code. Should you need an array for use in the editor however, blueprint or not, you should use <code>TArray</code>.</p>

","<p>I have no experience with Unreal Engine, but I see a couple things.</p>
<ol>
<li><code>&quot;attempt to index a nil value&quot;</code> should be interpreted as, in simplified form, you tried to do this: <code>nil[1]</code> or <code>nil:foo()</code>. The wording tends to trip some people up. In this case, it makes the most sense that <code>TimerManager</code> does not actually exist in your script because I see no declaration or require, and from the docs on UE4SS, it does not appear under the global-functions section of the API; but it's hard to tell without more details.</li>
<li>As I was reading through for ways to get a create Unreal classes, I came across the <code>LoopAsync</code> global function for setting up asynchronous loops. This should resolve your issue by foregoing the TimerManager completely, but if you still want to use that class specifically, you can look through to see if there's any global function that will create an Unreal class. From my read-through, it seems like you can only access ones already existing in memory, though.</li>

I always assume that (let's take a character Blueprint <code>BP_ThirdPersonCharacter</code> for example):<br />
(1) &quot;the GLOBAL character BP&quot; is &quot;a GLOBAL <code>C++</code> class (or equivalent)&quot; that inherits from all sub classes (which are indeed sub blueprints - which will instantiate components (in the picture) )<br />
(2) adding functions is just like adding functions for the GLOBAL BP (or class) above.<br />
(3) the same logic for adding variables, meaning adding variable members for the GLOBAL BP/class.<br />

","<p>Okay, so this is my very first answer in stackoverflow so I will try my best here.
I think you got everything there pretty much right, except the &quot;inherits from all sub classes&quot; point. In inheritance you don't inherit functionality from a subclass, it is the subclass that inherits from the parent class. But that was probably a typo.</p>
<p>Now, to your question: Think about Graphs like *.cpp files for the same *.h file. A Graph doesn't really have an equivalent in C++ because in C++ you will write all your operational and gameplay logic in a single *.cpp for a given class. But if you think about it, doing it entirely in the Blueprint (specially if it is a class with a lot of functionality) will make your graph too huge and confusing. That's why you can create multiple Graphs. You can have one for your basic events like BeginPlay() and Tick(), just like the image you uploaded, and another Graph named CustomEvents to handle events created by you like PlayerDeath() or OnPowerUpPickup() for example. In a .cpp file this would be all in the same file, in Blueprint you have this extra functionality to help you to organize things.
Just note that you cannot create equal events in different Graphs. For example, if you happen to have your BeginPlay() defined in the EventGraph, then you created a new Graph called MyGraph and tried to create BeginPlay() in there again Unreal will automatically jump you to the BeginPlay() event created in the EventGraph. Even if you try CtrlC+CtrlV the BeginPlay() node, Unreal will create a new CustomEvent node instead.</p>
<p>I hope this helps. :)</p>

73379955,Streaming Levels Limits?,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73379955/streaming-levels-limits,3,1660681702,"unreal-blueprint, unreal-engine5","<p>In UE it seems the only way to seamlessly travel between levels is with blueprint level streaming. My goal is to have a &quot;loading level&quot; which is a very basic, always loaded level that becomes visible when loading into a real level. Upon load completion, loading level plays an animation and then hides itself and fades into the real level.</p>
<p>I set up a map that I named <code>PersistentMap</code> that only has an actor <code>PersistentOrigin</code> which holds some global variables and event dispatchers. So all streamed sub-levels can use <code>PersistentOrigin</code> to send event calls (which are handled by <code>PersistentMap</code> blueprint) and use it's globals. The sub-levels in <code>PersistentMap</code> are the <code>LoadingMap</code>, <code>MainMenu</code> and various other sub-levels.</p>
<p>This has been working really well and smooth so far while testing, but my main concern is when I have more than 10 or so sub-levels with a lot of actors, meshes, and textures. And all being contained in <code>PersistentMap</code>.</p>
<p>So, I have a few questions regarding this setup, and all responses are valid and appreciated since this is very technical:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>On the editor side while developing, if I use the option <code>Show Stats &gt; Stats &gt; Engine &gt; Levels</code> for the <code>PersistentMap</code> it shows that all the sub-levels are &quot;Loaded Not Visible&quot;. Doesn't this mean that while I have this map open in the editor, all the sub-levels are loaded in memory? Is there a way to only load them if they're visible in the editor? I feel like this will get really taxing on my (and other devs') system later in development, no?</p>
</li>
<li><p>After building the game and launching it, does the amount of &quot;Unloaded&quot; sub-levels and their content in the <code>PersistentLevel</code> affect initial load time? When I play test, the <code>Level Stats</code> show all other levels as &quot;Unloaded&quot; when I would want them to be. Fine and dandy. I'm only assuming this means the amount of sub-levels won't affect the initial load time?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Is the method of communication between levels described above through event dispatchers and some variables in a <code>PersistentOrigin</code> actor viable? It at least made my blueprints cleaner when I thought of giving that a try...</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This has been something bothering me since I started developing with UE5, and can't find any in-depth or reputable sources for answers and/or work-arounds. Thank you to everyone in advance &lt;3</p>

<p>Here is an example of what I'm doing and what I want:</p>

<p>in GCC the compile error is</p>
<blockquote>
<p>type/value mismatch at argument 1 in template parameter list for
'template struct MyTrait'    27 | struct
MyTrait&lt;TemplateStruct::DefinedInTemplate&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That error is weird, <code>TemplateStruct&lt;T&gt;::DefinedInTemplate</code> is a type no ?</p>
<p>It should be noted that in my real case I can't replace the trait by a concept or something else. This is in UE5 where I must specialise an existing trait. So I can't get around specialising a trait, and I can't really modify that trait, as I'm trying to avoid editing the engine code. This trait is used a lot and I wouldn't be very comfortable touching it.</p>
","<p>This is because the <code>T</code> in <code>TemplateStruct&lt;T&gt;::DefinedInTemplate</code> is in a non-deduced context. Given just any type, we can't tell if it is <code>TemplateStruct&lt;T&gt;::DefinedInTemplate</code> for some <code>T</code> directly with existing C++ tools. It may be possible with C++ reflections in future versions.</p>
<p>A C++20 solution is to make a concept and partially specialise based on that:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>template&lt;typename T&gt;
concept IsDefinedInTemplateInsideTemplateStruct =
    std::same_as&lt;T, typename TemplateStruct&lt;decltype(T::val)&gt;::DefinedInTemplate&gt;;

template&lt;IsDefinedInTemplateInsideTemplateStruct T&gt;
struct MyTrait&lt;T&gt;
{
    static constexpr int value = 589;
};
</code></pre>
<p>A C++11 solution would be to make <code>DefinedInTemplate</code> an alias for some external template:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>namespace impl {
    template&lt;typename T&gt;
    struct TemplateStructInnerClass {
        T val;
    };
}

template&lt;typename T&gt;
struct TemplateStruct {
    using DefinedInTemplate = impl::TemplateStructInnerClass&lt;T&gt;;
};

template&lt;typename T&gt;
struct MyTrait&lt;impl::TemplateStructInnerClass&lt;T&gt;&gt;
{
    static constexpr int value = 589;

My approach involves utilizing Voronoi-based mesh fracturing, and I've discovered that Unreal Engine incorporates the <a href=""https://math.lbl.gov/voro++/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">voro++</a> library, which I want to use for this purpose.</p>
<p>To get started, I've been experimenting with <a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/API/Runtime/Voronoi/Voronoi/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Voronoi</a> and <a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/API/Plugins/DynamicMesh/FDynamicMesh3/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">DynamicMesh</a>.

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I am currently working on voxelizing point cloud data for utilization within the Unreal Engine. However, I'm encountering compatibility issues between the file formats supported by Unreal Engine and the output options available in Open3D.</p>
<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>The process of voxelizing point clouds using Open3D is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Load point cloud data in PLY format.</li>
<li>Voxelization of the point cloud data.</li>
<li>Save the voxelized data.</li>
</ol>
<p>The challenge arises at step 3, concerning the saving format. Presently, Open3D supports saving only in PLY format. However, my ultimate goal is to manipulate these data within Unreal Engine, which supports only the following file formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>*.xyz</li>
<li>*.pts</li>
<li>*.txt</li>
<li>*.las</li>
<li>*.laz</li>

<h2>Current Measures and Challenges</h2>
<p>Due to the limitations in saving options in Open3D, I am exploring other libraries or tools but have yet to find a suitable solution.

<h2>Inquiry</h2>

However, when I bind this delegate to different events in Blueprints, all of them get called even if the delegate is triggered only once.</p>
<p>Here's the C++ code for my Get method and the delegate broadcast:</p>
<pre><code>void UGameInstanceBase::Get(const FString&amp; apiEndPoint) {
    // ... HTTP request setup ...
    HttpRequest-&gt;OnProcessRequestComplete().BindUObject(this, &amp;UGameInstanceBase::OnResponseReceived);

<p>And in my Blueprint, I have two separate bindings to this delegate, expecting them to be called independently:</p>
<p>Binding at location 1 in the Blueprint (intended for one type of response).
Binding at location 2 in the Blueprint (intended for another type of response).
However, when I trigger the delegate from a response, both bindings are called.</p>
<p>I need to ensure that each call to <code>Get</code> results in only the corresponding event being called in the Blueprint.</p>
<p>Could someone explain why this might be happening and how I can ensure that each Get request only calls its corresponding response event in the Blueprint?</p>

<p>Unlike the recently depreciated old input system, holding down two opposite directional keys (e.g. keyboard [W] and [S]) will not cancel each other out, rather the last listed key set up in the Input Mapping Context will take priority and move the character in that direction - in this case the character moves backwards when [W] and [S] are held at the same time.</p>

<p>Is there a way for multiple key presses for the same Input Action to be processed before it returns a value for use in code? Essentially, I want the FVector2D value to be (0, 0) when all four directional keys are pressed and should cancel each other out.</p>
<p>I tried adding values on top of each other for each call of the move callback, however this doesn't seems to work as the callback only seems to be called once for the last listed key as mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>What is especially strange is that the returned FVector2D contains axial values in both X ([W] &amp; [S]) and Y ([A] &amp; [D]) so multiple keys are clearly being processed, yet for the same axis it seems like the last listed key overwrites the value.</p>

","<p>Looking at the source code for the FChaosPhysicsMaterial class, I'd say Static Friction is specifically the resistance to the <strong>start</strong> of motion. It's the threshold of force required to transition an object from a stationary state to a moving one. This parameter is not a factor once the object is in motion; at that point, the regular Friction parameter takes precedence.</p>
<p>Let's say you're simulating a block of ice, so you might set a Static Friction of 0.1 to indicate that not much force is needed to start the block moving. The Friction might be set to 0.2, indicating that once moving, the block still slides easily but with slightly more resistance than when it was stationary.</p>

<p>The approach, instead, should be to get the actor's component. For this, if you know the class of the component ahead of time, and you know there is only one of that type, you can use <a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/API/Runtime/Engine/GameFramework/AActor/GetComponentByClass/1/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>GetComponentByClass</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>USpotLightComponent* SpotLight = LaserLightActor-&gt;GetComponentByClass&lt;USpotLightComponent&gt;();
</code></pre>
<p>There are also other functions to get an actor's component, for different use cases, like: <code>FindComponentByClass</code>, <code>FindComponentByInterface</code>, <code>FindComponentByTag</code>, <code>GetComponents</code>, <code>GetComponentsByTag</code>, etc.</p>

<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>// A switchable character. In-memory only. Either ANSICHAR or WIDECHAR, depending on a licensee's requirements.
typedef WIDECHAR            TCHAR;
</code></pre>
<p>It's not just TCHAR, it's in the comments for all character types. What's the meaning of &quot;In-memory only&quot;?</p>
","<p>Unreal uses platform definition files, such as <code>GenericPlatform.h</code>, <code>AndroidPlatform.h</code>, etc., to specify how certain aspects of the engine, like templated classes using platform-dependent integer sizes, or character widths, behave on different platforms.</p>
<p>So the same macro, i.e. <code>TCHAR</code>, on Windows and iOS, might mean a different underlying type, and related classes (such as <code>FString</code>) would then behave slightly differently on those platforms, representing values <em>in-memory</em> in a way that's better optimized for the underlying architecture.</p>
<p>However, on-disk data, such as a text file, should strive for cross-platform compatibility. So the same string on two platforms with different character lengths should be saved to disk in the same way. That's why such classes are serialized with an encoding and character length that are not necessarily the same as their in-memory representation.</p>
<p>For example, when you save an <code>FString</code> to a file with <code>FFileHelper::SaveStringToFile</code>, UE re-encodes its in-memory characters to on-disk characters of the type you specify (ANSI or UTF-8 or whatever), as it makes very little sense to directly save a file containing whatever <code>wchar_t</code> is (it's implementation specific and differs in bit length).</p>

76144648,Applying torque in a direction only if the angular velocity of a ball is not too high,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76144648/applying-torque-in-a-direction-only-if-the-angular-velocity-of-a-ball-is-not-too,2,1682913430,"c++, math, calculus, unreal-engine5, vectormath","<p>I am trying to implement a move system for a ball in Unreal Engine 5. The user can apply torque to a ball to let the ball spin in a certain direction depending on the position of the camera in a 3D game. I am having problems with implementing a good solution for the movement of the ball.</p>
<p>My code so far is as following down below.</p>
<pre><code>void ABallie::Move(const FInputActionValue &amp;Value)
{
    if (Controller != nullptr)
    {
        FVector2D MoveValue = Value.Get&lt;FVector2D&gt;();
        // GEngine-&gt;AddOnScreenDebugMessage(-1, 15.0f, FColor::Yellow, FString::Printf(TEXT(&quot;X: %f | Y: %f&quot;), MoveValue.X, MoveValue.Y));

        FVector ForwardDirection = Camera-&gt;GetRightVector() * MoveValue.Y;
        ForwardDirection.Z = 0;

        FVector SideDirection = Camera-&gt;GetForwardVector() * MoveValue.X;
        SideDirection.Z = 0;

        FVector Direction = (ForwardDirection + SideDirection).GetSafeNormal(0.001);
        Direction *= TorqueStrength;

        MainBody-&gt;AddTorqueInRadians(Direction, &quot;MainBody&quot;, true);

        if (MainBody-&gt;GetPhysicsAngularVelocityInRadians().Length() &gt; MaxRadialVelocityInRadians)
        {
            MainBody-&gt;AddTorqueInRadians(-Direction, &quot;MainBody&quot;, true);
        }
        GEngine-&gt;AddOnScreenDebugMessage(-1, 15.0f, FColor::Yellow, FString::Printf(TEXT(&quot;Velocity: %f&quot;), MainBody-&gt;GetPhysicsAngularVelocityInRadians().Length()));
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Explanation: <code>MoveValue</code> tells me in a 2D vector which keys WASD the user has pressed. X ranges from 1 to -1 (&quot;W&quot;=1, &quot;S&quot;=-1) and Y ranges also from 1 to -1 (&quot;A&quot;=1, &quot;D&quot;=-1). I get the forward and right vector of the camera and multiply it accordingly to get the forward and side vector that the torque should be applied upon. Adding and normalizing the forward and side vector to get the desired direction vector. Multiplying the direction vector with <code>TorqueStrength</code> to give me the final torque vector, which overwrites <code>Direction</code>.</p>
<p>The crucial part is this here. It works kinda ok but it won't give control to the player to spin in one direction if the ball goes faster than the max in another direction (Going max velocity in one direction but 0 in the other won't let the player spin in the other direction whatsoever).</p>
<ul>
<li>Apply the torque in the desired direction</li>
<li>Check if the angular velocity afterwards is higher than <code>MaxRadialVelocityInRadians</code></li>
<li>If it is higher than <code>MaxRadialVelocityInRadians</code>, then &quot;unapply&quot; the torque by just adding the negative version of the torque vector</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>        FVector Direction = (ForwardDirection + SideDirection).GetSafeNormal(0.001);
        Direction *= TorqueStrength;
        MainBody-&gt;AddTorqueInRadians(Direction, &quot;MainBody&quot;, true);

        if (MainBody-&gt;GetPhysicsAngularVelocityInRadians().Length() &gt; MaxRadialVelocityInRadians)
        {
            MainBody-&gt;AddTorqueInRadians(-Direction, &quot;MainBody&quot;, true);
        }
</code></pre>
<p>I wanted to somehow make it work in a better way and came up with this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the current angular velocity vector of the ball <code>AngularVelocity</code></li>
<li>Check if the dot product of <code>AngularVelocity</code> with <code>Direction</code> is lower than <code>MaxRadialVelocityInRadians</code></li>
<li>If true, then apply the torque vector to the ball</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>
        FVector Direction = (ForwardDirection + SideDirection).GetSafeNormal(0.001);

        FVector AngularVelocity = MainBody-&gt;GetPhysicsAngularVelocityInRadians();

        if (FVector::DotProduct(AngularVelocity, Direction) &lt; MaxRadialVelocityInRadians)
        {
            Direction *= TorqueStrength;
            MainBody-&gt;AddTorqueInRadians(Direction, &quot;MainBody&quot;, true);
        }
</code></pre>
<p>But this fails because you can get faster by looking left and right while pressing forward or tapping A and D quickly while moving forward. Example: Just pressing <code>W</code> to move forward to get to top speed of let's say 20 radians. Then suddenly pressing <code>A</code> while holding <code>W</code> will increase the spinning speed to 24 and decrease after 1-2 secs down to 20 again. My first solution will always keep it at 20 no matter what I try, same goes with the in-engine property to set a general max angular velocity on the object <code>Max Angular Velocity</code> under <code>Physics</code> category on the object property settings.</p>
<p>My whole idea with the last approach was to check if the angular velocity in the direction of which I want to apply the torque to is lower than the max angular velocity that is allowed and only apply torque if the ball is spinning slower than the max in that direction.  So I attempted to do a scalar projection of the angular velocity vector onto the normalized direction vector. But yeah...</p>
<p>Is my conception wrong? I feel like my math is off on this one! Any help appreciated.</p>
<p>My goal is to achieve a max angular velocity. I could just tick the physics property &quot;Max Angular Velocity&quot; in the Engine on the ball and put in some value but this would also make the ball never spin faster than that max value I put in. But I want to have outside forces to still be able to make the ball spin faster than the player can by using controls, e.g. down a slope it should be possible for the ball to spin faster than the max value. It just shouldn't be possible to achieve a faster spinning velocity than the max through player input.</p>
<p>Thanks for the time reading through my problem!</p>

I want to detect when the ball is touching the floor and when it's not (like I could do with OnCollisionEnter and OnCollisionExit in Unity).</p>
<p>To do that in Unreal, do I need 2 sphere components, one to collide with the floor that will trigger OnComponentHit event and another one little bit bigger that will overlap the floor and trigger OnComponentOverlapEvent? Or I can use a single sphere component that will collide with the floor and at the same time will trigger both events?</p>
","<p><code>OnComponentOverlap</code> and <code>OnComponentHit</code> can indeed be generated by the same <code>UPrimitiveComponent</code> such as a sphere collision. However, usually not with the same object: depending on the collision settings, the sphere would either &quot;hit&quot; the floor or &quot;overlap&quot; it.</p>
<p><code>OnHit</code> gets called if the component is set to &quot;block&quot; collision and is doing a physics simulation, and <code>OnComponentOverlap</code> if it's set to &quot;overlap&quot;, which would mean there's no physics interaction and they can go through each other. If it's set to &quot;ignore&quot;, neither will trigger.</p>
<p>It can happen that the same component is set to &quot;block&quot; some things and &quot;overlap&quot; others, in which case both events will be called at different times.</p>
<p>If you need to have a sphere that both triggers hit events when exactly touching the floor, but also overlap events when it's roughly on the floor, you can indeed use two different components, with different collision settings, and slightly different sizes.</p>
<p>Most of the information in the OnHit and OnOverlap events is quite similar, so depending on the exact use case, it might be possible to get by with just one. However, for sphere-plane collision (and any primitive-primitive collision like capsule-box), the overlap calculation is extremely cheap, so there's virtuall no performance difference between using one and two.</p>

Also one week ago it worked pretty fine, and I’m sure I didn’t touch Android SDK myself. Unfortunately the log gives no clue what exactly is wrong.</p>

<p>Given the above array of cubes.  Green is the starting position, red being the end position.  How can I determine the number of cubes I would have to travel from start to end.</p>
<p>This is done in UnrealEngine, each individual cube is a blueprint actor in the scene.</p>
<p>I can determine distance by casting a ray from start point to end point, but this would give me a direct distance between the two points.  I'd like to find the number of cubes i'd have to travel through to get to the end.</p>
","<p>Given a 3x3x3 and 2 positions, the # of cubes you'd have to travel would be a pretty straightforward thing to calculate, and more of a math thing than a Unreal Engine problem.</p>
<p>If I can assume you can't travel diagonally:</p>
<p>This is <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Taxicab/Manhattan</a> distance, just in 3D.</p>
<p>Assuming that all cubes are traversable, you just need to sum the differences in all 3 dimensions between the 2 positions:</p>
<p>Travel Distance = |x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1| + |z2 - z1|</p>

I decided to use steam lobbies and now I'm struggling with configuration of the lobby type / permissions.</p>
<p><strong>Goal: I want to have a possibility to invite players (steam friends) to my lobby only if my user is a lobby owner</strong>, I want my lobby to be a private one to prevent other users to join the lobby w/o invite from LO.</p>
<p>So, from steam UI perspective: I want to be sure that option <em><strong>Invite to Game</strong></em> will be displayed only to lobby owner when he clicks on someone in his steam friends list view.</p>
<p>If user is already participating in any lobby but he is not a lobby owner - no invite/join -related options should be displayed within the steam UI. <strong>How can I do so using steam SDK?</strong></p>
<p>Context: I'm working with Unreal Engine 5 which provides me a steam online subsystem (based on steamworks sdk). After investigation I've found out that the call to steam backend <code>SteamMatchmaking()-&gt;SetLobbyType(SessionId, LobbyType)</code> affects the target context menu in friend list, but if this is the only place where it could be configured - I cannot find any perfect value of <code>ELobbyType LobbyType</code> that could help me to reach my particular goal.</p>
<p>Here are all possible types:</p>
<pre><code>// lobby type description
enum ELobbyType
{
    k_ELobbyTypePrivate = 0,        // only way to join the lobby is to invite to someone else
    k_ELobbyTypeFriendsOnly = 1,    // shows for friends or invitees, but not in lobby list
    k_ELobbyTypePublic = 2,         // visible for friends and in lobby list
    k_ELobbyTypeInvisible = 3,      // returned by search, but not visible to other friends 
                                    //    useful if you want a user in two lobbies, for example matching groups together
                                    //    a user can be in only one regular lobby, and up to two invisible lobbies
    k_ELobbyTypePrivateUnique = 4,  // private, unique and does not delete when empty - only one of these may exist per unique keypair set
                                    // can only create from webapi
};
</code></pre>
<p>As I thought, the most logical type for my case should be a <code>k_ELobbyTypePrivate</code>, cause I want my lobby to be a private one and only lobby owner should be responsible for invites. But if I pass this one to <code>SetLobbyType</code>, I won't have an option to invite a friend to my lobby session.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/ChN2k.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/ChN2k.png"" alt=""k_ELobbyTypePrivate"" /></a></p>
<p>If I use <code>k_ELobbyTypePublic</code> - all my friends have an ability to <em><strong>Join Game</strong></em> which is not acceptable.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/vwst5.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/vwst5.png"" alt=""k_ELobbyTypePublic"" /></a></p>
<p>For sure, I can manage this stuff within the code and decide whether to accept particular user to public lobby or decline, but I'd like to do not have a join option within this context menu at all. As I understand <code>k_ELobbyTypeFriendsOnly</code> acts like public but just for friends, so its not suitable for me, as well as <code>k_ELobbyTypeInvisible</code> and <code>k_ELobbyTypePrivateUnique</code> according to their discriptions in comments.</p>
<p>Also I have a related question, why in CS:GO &quot;Invite to Play&quot; is displayed instead of &quot;Invite to Game&quot; as in my case when public lobby type is chosen? Is it configurable somewhere (e.g. on steampartner side or so), or in CS:GO its done outside of steamworks sdk layer?</p>

76751239,What&#39;s better way to figure out buffer size in a AudioFrame per a call &#39;onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixing&#39;,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76751239/whats-better-way-to-figure-out-buffer-size-in-a-audioframe-per-a-call-onplayba,0,1690169674,"agora.io, unreal-engine5, agora","<p>I'm using Agora unreal-engine plugin in My UE Project.
I need to use Audio-frame not mixing in a thirdparty stuff.
So I implement IAudioFrameObserver and I receive audio-frame on a onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixing callback.
I have always crash within copying buffer in the AudioFrame passed.
Firsttime, I thought the cause would be about the synchronization problem between threads because get the crash after more times than 10 the callback is successful.
So I guard the thread-safe codes using several methods UE provide.
But The crash is still. the crash point is copy the buffer like below:</p>
<pre><code>bool MyAudoFrameObserver::onPlaybackAudioFrameBeforeMixing(
    const char* channelId,
     agora::rtc::uid_t UserId,
     IAudioFrameObserverBase::AudioFrame&amp; audioFrame)
{
size_t bytes = audioFrame.samplesPerSec * audioFrame.bytesPerSample * audioFrame.channels;
char mybuffer[32000];
FMemory::Memcpy(mybuffer, audioFrame.buffer,fmin(32000,bytes)); // here crash point

// send mybuffer to another thread side stuff.

return true;
</code></pre>
<p>I think deeply over, then I pretty doubt to calculate buffer size.
'AudioFrame' definition comment help say Buffer data size: buffer = samples × channels × bytesPerSample.
I just did follow to that. the result is 32000 constantly.
Now I noticed the 'samples' should be number of sample per call instead of samplesPerSec. (for me 16000).
Actually I see the callback is called per around 0.01ms (not always) in the log.
So, that means I have to check the frame's delta time in that call sequence and get the delta-time * samperate(16000). for instance, samples = 0.01 * 16000 (samplesPerSec) = 160
If not so, other way, I have to store evey frames for 1sec? If so, sure I get it samples but I would not find the number of sample to copy buffer per call.</p>
<p>I'm in a wrong?
What's the correct way to copy buffer per call?
I should can find the precise size of the audio-frame's buffer per call.</p>
<p>Please anyone helps.</p>

76691043,Unreal Engine 5 - Can’t Join another player’s Session through EOS,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76691043/unreal-engine-5-can-t-join-another-player-s-session-through-eos,1,1689367651,"unreal-engine5, eos, epic-online-services","<p>I'm trying to build a Peer-2-Peer multiplayer game using EOS (Epic Online Services) Online Subsystem in Unreal Engine 5.1.1.</p>
<p><strong>The Setup:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>I configured my organization (product, application, client, client policy) in the Epic Developer Portal. Then I enabled in the project the plugins Online Subsystem EOS, EOS Shared, EOS Voice Chat &amp; Socket Subsystem EOS, but not the Online Services EOS nor the Online Services EOS (Game Services).</p>
</li>
<li><p>I configured in the Settings the Online Subsystem EOS, and the Artifact with the Settings in my Epic Developer Portal. And added the lines that the documentation specifies for the DefaultEngine.ini</p>
</li>
<li><p>After that I created a normal multiplayer functionality with the Advanced Sessions Plugin, through blueprints where you can create a session or join a session. Here you login first with the &quot;accountportal&quot; authentication every time. I have tested with 2 different accounts in the Standalone Mode, and I have also tested it with another computer and another account with a packaged project.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Issue:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The player that hosts or creates the session, logs in well and creates the session well and it appears in the Developer Portal, so it works as it should. The problem comes when the player that wants to join that session tries to join.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The second player logs in with a different account, then it looks for sessions, finds the one, tries to join it and shows up as successful (I have a print node after the FindSession node is successful), then this player's screen stays there in the Menu Level waiting to actually join the Host's Level, as if something was happening in the background, and then suddenly reloads the Menu Level as if something had gone wrong.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Logs:</strong>
As this is happening, I'm looking at the logs to see why everything is happening the way that it is</p>

<p>I don't know why, but there's a timeout happening, I turned off my Windows' Firewalls and still have the same problem. I really don't know what could be happening. Thanks in advance, I added a lot of context because I know that it's always really good to have a nice idea of wtf is happening haha, so yeah, I would greatly appreciate some input.</p>
<p>Edit: I do see in the Joiner's log, the mention of the IP &quot;MyIP:7777&quot;, and I don't know if this even makes sense, but when I write that in my browser, while the games are running, the browser also times out, so maybe something with the Joiner grabbing the wrong IP?</p>

I am making it that the player can open programs and they will display in thier own windows that can be moved around just like on a real desktop.

I need it so that the player can not click the button when there is a window covering it. But i want the button to be clckable when the window is not covering it(like how it works on a real desktop.). I know i can make the button not clickable by using <code>not hit testable</code> but i need code that can tell if the button is covered by another widget. What would be the best way to do this (preferably something that can be done using blueprints in unreal.).</p>

","<p>it is not possible to talk to the level blueprint through a widget as far as i know. I'm not sure what you are trying to do as you could just execute the respawn code through the widget using on clicked. I would stay away from using the level blueprint as it is harder to cast to. I would use something like a game instance,player charater or even the game mode or an actor.

76526208,How to unit test with data assets C++ Unreal Engine,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76526208/how-to-unit-test-with-data-assets-c-unreal-engine,0,1687372504,"unreal-engine4, unreal-engine5","<p>I am adding some unit tests to my C++ plugin for Unreal Engine.
I am currently using the <a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.2/en-US/automation-system-in-unreal-engine/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Automation System</a> for that.
I already have working unit tests for the structs and some simple UObjects.</p>
<p>However I am stumbling on a case I don't really know how to handle correctly.
I have an UObject (say <code>UEntity</code>) which is instantiated at runtime and is setup with a UDataAsset (say <code>UEntityData</code>) that the designers can create in the editor to fill some data inside.
The <code>UEntityData</code> contains an array and the <code>UEntity</code> access it for some behavior.</p>
<p>My problem here is: How can I provide the <code>UEntityData</code> to the <code>UEntity</code> in the unit test?</p>
<p>I have some solutions in mind but since I can't find anything on the Internet relating this case I don't know the best approach.</p>
<ul>
<li>I could maybe create the data assets with <code>NewObject&lt;&gt;()</code> inside the unit test and filling its members before providing them to the <code>UEntity</code> instances. (I don't know if it's correct behaviour to use <code>NewObject&lt;&gt;()</code> with <code>UDataAsset</code> classes, and also I am wondering if it's going beyond the unit testing since I'm relying on some other class constructor and accessors).</li>
<li>I could create some data asset files in the editor and loading them in the unit tests, however I think it's not a reliable way because the assets are outside the unit tests environment (maybe I'm wrong with this feeling).</li>
<li>I could create another way to mock up those data assets without using the <code>UEntityData</code> class but I'm feeling that this is breaking the purpose of the unit test since it is not really testing the real behavior and cumbersome to duplicate the members and functions between the data assets and the non-data asset mocks. (maybe I'm wrong also here)</li>
</ul>
<p>So I'm asking here if anybody can lead me to the best way to deal with data assets in unit tests?</p>
","<p>Creatinig <code>UDataAsset</code>s using templated <code>UObject</code> macros such as <code>NewObject</code>, <code>NewNamedObject</code>, <code>ConstructObject</code> is totally fine, and seems like the best approach, for reasons you have noted: indeed, it is best to keep all tests self-contained and not rely on external assets such as ones created in Editor. It also good practice to use the exact classes you will use for the real-world use case.</p>
<p>Data Asset can be treated as plain <code>UObject</code> in code, meaning it is supported by <code>UPROPERTY</code>, can have/be <code>Outer</code> for other objects, rely on reference-based garbage collection, etc. All properties of the Data Asset can safely be assigned/changed in code.</p>

<p>I have copypasted my own source files I wrote outside of Unreal into the &quot;private&quot; (for cpp-files) and the &quot;public&quot; (for my header files) folders of an unreal-C++-Project, so I can include my own custom classes in my unreal source files.</p>
<p>It works as it should, but I want to use my own enums, that are obviously defined in my own non-Unreal-specific Files, as UEnums, so I have to modify them there with Unreal-specific Macros.</p>
<p>Will Unreal Header Tool incorporate my own Files or only the ones I created from the Unreal Editor?
And do I need to write a &quot;...generated.h&quot;-include in my own custom headers I wrote outside of Unreal?</p>
<p>Thank you so much in advance!</p>
<p>I did this:</p>
<ul>
<li>first I added a generated.h. My File is named like &quot;File.h&quot;, and I added a generated.h-include in it like this:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>#include &quot;File.generated.h&quot;

</code></pre>
<p>Of course as the last include, as it should be.</p>
<ul>
<li>Then I added the Unreal-Macros to the enum. It went from this:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>enum MyEnum {
    FIRST_ENTRY,
    SECOND_ENTRY
};
</code></pre>
<p>to this:</p>
<pre><code>UENUM(BlueprintType, Category=&quot;Enums&quot;)
enum MyEnum {
    FIRST_ENTRY UMETA(DisplayName=&quot;First Entry&quot;),
    SECOND_ENTRY UMETA(DisplayName=&quot;Second Entry&quot;)
};
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Then I tried to incorporate a variable with this Enum type as a UProperty in one of my Unreal-Classes like this:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite)
    TEnumAsByte&lt;MyEnum&gt; EnumVariable;
</code></pre>
<p>Sadly I get an Error:</p>
<p>&quot;Error: Expected the name of a previously defined enum&quot;</p>
<p>Of course I included the Header File with my Enum before, so this cannot be the reason I guess.</p>

76271979,UStaticMeshComponent::SetStaticMesh() crash; how to create a static mesh from raw mesh data in UE5?,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76271979/ustaticmeshcomponentsetstaticmesh-crash-how-to-create-a-static-mesh-from-ra,0,1684325580,"c++, unreal-engine5","<p>I am trying to create a static mesh from a raw mesh data (vertex + index buffer) at runtime.</p>
<p>First, I was able to successfully create a static sphere mesh (using <code>StaticLoadObject</code> to load &quot;/Engine/BasicShapes/Sphere&quot;) and to assign the same material (as returned by <code>AMyActor::CreateMaterial</code> below).</p>
<p>Then, instead of the sphere mesh, I want to create my vertex and index data at runtime.</p>
<p>With information I found around, I wrote the following code:</p>
<pre><code>UStaticMeshComponent* AMyActor::CreateMesh(AActor* ActorOwner, FLinearColor Color)
{
    FRawMesh RawMesh;
    RawMesh.VertexPositions.Emplace(FVector(0.f, 0.f, 0.f));
    RawMesh.VertexPositions.Emplace(FVector(100.f, 0.f, 0.f));
    RawMesh.VertexPositions.Emplace(FVector(100.f, 100.f, 0.f));
    RawMesh.VertexPositions.Emplace(FVector(0.f, 100.f, 0.f));

    RawMesh.WedgeIndices.Emplace(0);
    RawMesh.WedgeIndices.Emplace(1);
    RawMesh.WedgeIndices.Emplace(2);

    RawMesh.WedgeIndices.Emplace(0);

    RawMesh.WedgeIndices.Emplace(3);

    RawMesh.WedgeIndices.Emplace(1);
    RawMesh.WedgeIndices.Emplace(0);
    RawMesh.WedgeIndices.Emplace(3);

    RawMesh.WedgeIndices.Emplace(1);
    RawMesh.WedgeIndices.Emplace(3);
    RawMesh.WedgeIndices.Emplace(2);

    // Create a static mesh from the FRawMesh
    UStaticMesh* StaticMesh = NewObject&lt;UStaticMesh&gt;();
    StaticMesh-&gt;AddSourceModel();
    FStaticMeshSourceModel&amp; SourceModel = StaticMesh-&gt;GetSourceModel(0);
    SourceModel.RawMeshBulkData-&gt;SaveRawMesh(RawMesh);

    StaticMesh-&gt;Build(false);

    UStaticMeshComponent* Mesh = NewObject&lt;UStaticMeshComponent&gt;(ActorOwner);
    UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT(&quot;Calling Mesh-&gt;SetStaticMesh(%x)...&quot;), (void*)StaticMesh);
    // crashes here:
    Mesh-&gt;SetStaticMesh(StaticMesh);
    Mesh-&gt;SetMaterial(0, CreateMaterial(Color));
    Mesh-&gt;SetCollisionProfileName(TEXT(&quot;Pawn&quot;));
    Mesh-&gt;SetHiddenInGame(false);
    Mesh-&gt;RegisterComponent();
    return Mesh;
}

UMaterialInstanceDynamic* AMyActor::CreateMaterial(FLinearColor Color)
{
    FStringAssetReference MaterialRef(TEXT(&quot;/Game/SimBlank/Materials/GlossyRedMaterial&quot;));
    UMaterialInterface* LoadedMaterial = Cast&lt;UMaterialInterface&gt;(StaticLoadObject(UMaterialInterface::StaticClass(), nullptr, *MaterialRef.ToString()));
    UMaterialInstanceDynamic* NewMaterial = UMaterialInstanceDynamic::Create(LoadedMaterial, this);
    NewMaterial-&gt;SetVectorParameterValue(&quot;BaseColor&quot;, Color);
    return NewMaterial;
}
</code></pre>
<p>which I call in the first tick of my plugin, with:</p>
<pre><code>MeshActor = World-&gt;SpawnActor&lt;AActor&gt;();
MeshActor-&gt;SetRootComponent(CreateMesh(MeshActor, FLinearColor::Gray));
MeshActor-&gt;SetActorLocation(GetActorLocation() + FVector(100.0f, 0.0f, 40.0f));
</code></pre>
<p>but the above code crashes at <code>Mesh-&gt;SetStaticMesh(StaticMesh);</code>.</p>
<p>Before crashing it prints:</p>
<p>Assertion failed: (Index &gt;= 0) &amp; (Index &lt; ArrayNum) [File:D:\build++UE5\Sync\Engine\Source\Runtime\Core\Public\Containers\Array.h] [Line: 752] Array index out of bounds: 0 from an array of size 0</p>
<p>To make a simpler test, I removed the part where I create the <code>FRawMesh</code> and also the call to <code>SourceModel.RawMeshBulkData-&gt;SaveRawMesh(RawMesh)</code>, however it crashes in the same way, with the same assertion failed message. Code:</p>
<pre><code>UStaticMeshComponent* AMyActor::CreateMesh(AActor* ActorOwner, FLinearColor Color)
{
    UStaticMesh* StaticMesh = NewObject&lt;UStaticMesh&gt;();
    StaticMesh-&gt;AddSourceModel();
    FStaticMeshSourceModel&amp; SourceModel = StaticMesh-&gt;GetSourceModel(0);
    //SourceModel.RawMeshBulkData-&gt;SaveRawMesh(RawMesh);

    StaticMesh-&gt;Build(false);

    UStaticMeshComponent* Mesh = NewObject&lt;UStaticMeshComponent&gt;(ActorOwner);
    UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT(&quot;Calling Mesh-&gt;SetStaticMesh(%x)...&quot;), (void*)StaticMesh);
    // crashes here:

    Mesh-&gt;SetCollisionProfileName(TEXT(&quot;Pawn&quot;));
    Mesh-&gt;SetHiddenInGame(false);
    Mesh-&gt;RegisterComponent();
    return Mesh;
}

<h3>Question</h3>
<p>What C++ concept am I missing here?</p>
","<p>There is already an accepted answer to this question, but it's vague and based on guessing, so I'll try to give a more definitive answer:</p>
<p>When declaring a class that can be replicated, it has to be defined as either an <code>AActor</code> or a <code>UActorComponent</code>. Both of which use the <code>UCLASS()</code> macro to denote that the following class declaration needs to be integrated into Unreals reflection using the Unreal Header Tool (UHT) which runs before the actual build and generates code. This code is written into a generated header file called &quot;foo.generated.h&quot; and code file called &quot;foo.gen.cpp&quot; where &quot;foo&quot; stands for your header filename (without extension). The header is always the last include in your header and exists once per header file, not per class.</p>
<p>Inside of the class, you also have to call the <code>GENERATED_BODY()</code> macro (or alternatively the <code>GENERATED_UCLASS_BODY()</code> macro, but I believe that's legacy stuff). That's where the code goes that's generated for the class itself by the UHT. It contains information about the <code>UPROPERTY()</code> and <code>UFUNCTION()</code> declarations and, if you are using the reflection on the class, also declares an override of <code>GetLifetimeReplicatedProps()</code> that you then have to implement.</p>
<p>This is not the only method that is declared by the UHT. If you are using RPCs, you also have to create an implementation to something you did not actually declare. A method declared as <code>Foo()</code> will have <code>Foo_Implementation()</code> as a body (because the implementation of the actual <code>Foo()</code> will be created via UHT, calling your implementation at some point) and optionally even a <code>Foo_Validate()</code>.</p>
<p>You can read more about this <a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/rpcs-in-unreal-engine/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>
<p>Regarding the UHT, Unreals docs are <a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/unreal-headr-tool-for-unreal-engine/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">very vague</a>, but I encourage you to look into its code <a href=""https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/tree/release/Engine/Source/Programs/UnrealHeaderTool"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">on their GitHub</a>. Also, you can actually &quot;go to declaration&quot; of <code>GetLifetimeReplicatedProps()</code> after doing a compile. You should be able to view the generated code in the headers, they are located in the &quot;Intermediate/Build&quot; folders of your project.</p>

75128221,Unreal Engine 5.1 Retargeted Animation From Manny to Mixamo Model Causes Single Animation Sequence To Rotate 90*,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75128221/unreal-engine-5-1-retargeted-animation-from-manny-to-mixamo-model-causes-single,1,1673814876,unreal-engine5,"<p>I apologize if this has been asked before. I tried searching for this first and nothing is coming up. I'm pretty new to Unreal Engine 5.1 so this might be something I'm doing as well.</p>
<p>I've been exploring animation retargeting in unreal and have tried following the steps we learned in class using one of the models from mixamo.com. Everything appears to work fine at the start and I can get the actual IK and IKR objects working just fine. However when I try to export the animations either from the IKR object or by right clicking the ABP object for the source mesh one and only one of the animation sequences rotates 90*. It is always the same animation (the Land animation sequence) and I'm not sure how to go about fixing it.</p>
<p>Also tried looking on google and turned up nothing.</p>
<p>I'm hoping this is some stupid newb mistake that is easy to fix or maybe there's something I'm overlooking. Any help is greatly appreciated and I will continue trying to fix the problem myself as well and will post if I fix it</p>
<p>Tried retargeting using the following steps</p>
<ol>
<li>Create an IK_Object for the model you wish to project your animations on with chains for each. Mine looked like the following
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/yyFQx.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IK_Remy</a></li>
<li>Repeat step 1 for the model you wish to source animations from. Mine looked like the following
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/CTIfr.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IK_Manny</a></li>
<li>Create an IKR_Object Linking the two together, here's what mine looked like
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/a1Jyj.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IKR_Remy</a></li>
<li>Find the ABP for your source model, right click, and select &quot;Retarget Animation Assets-&gt;Duplicate and Retarget Animation Assets&quot;. Here's what I'm selecting for that
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/qj9bZ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Retarget Dialog</a></li>
</ol>
<p>When I do the following most of the animation sequences for &quot;Manny&quot; export just fine. However the &quot;Land&quot; animation flips for some reason (see image below)</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/VtSAX.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Exported Animation Images</a></p>
<p>Even stranger, when I preview the MM_Land animation in my IKR object it looks fine i.e. not rotated. However, if I try to export the animation from the IKR object the same thing happens i.e. it rotates 90*. I would expect this to be a case of WYSIWYG where if it's working in the preview it would export correctly. However that apparently is not the case</p>
<p>Also I tried modifying the animation sequence manually but it won't let me. If I try to rotate the model in the animation sequence and save it, once I close the sequence it's re-rotated and the changes do not persist.</p>
<p>I can export the sequence as a new sequence, modify it, and save it, and then rename it as my exported &quot;Land&quot; animation to hard force it and it at least looks normal. However when I actually play the game and jump, when the land animation it still flips sideways and in addition causes the character to scale and warp for a second which makes me think there's something going on here that I don't know enough to fix. Really hoping someone with more experience in Unreal Engine can help.</p>

","<p>In C++, you can have a &quot;construction script&quot; functionality that will respond to any values you set in blueprint, if you add the following override:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>//.h

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/6gjgs.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/6gjgs.png"" alt=""static mesh properties"" /></a></p>
<p>If the stats panel isn't lying, I'm losing about 170mb of memory to a set of 8k textures I never want to have or use.</p>
<p>I have tried closing and reloading the editor just to see if it was a weird glitch, but it remains constant no matter what I try.</p>
<p>I'm using version: 5.1.1-23901901+++UE5+Release-5.1</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
","<p>First, did you change the material on the mesh in a level or in the mesh editor itself, this matters as you would just be overriding by overlay changing it in instance or level.</p>
<p>Second, Did you try clearing DDC?  <a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/derived-data-cache/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/derived-data-cache/</a></p>
<p>Is the Material using all of those to build the finished? As in for albedo, normal etc &quot;sharing textures for LOD&quot;?</p>

I also have a Character class called PlayerCharacter in this class, i have a refrence to Door1, the thing is that i want to be able to call a function that is defiened in DoorSceneComponent from the PlayerCharacter class.

I use Unreal Engine 5.1
I use Manjaro Linux as my OS.
If you need any more information just say.
Thanks :)</p>
","<p>This one takes a couple separate parts.
Firstly, you'll want to hold a pointer to an instance of your <code>DoorSceneComponent</code>. So in your Door1 header:</p>
<p>Door1.h</p>
<pre><code>private: //(or protected, depending on your needs)
UPROPERTY()
DoorSceneComponent* DoorComp;
</code></pre>
<p>(If it has properties that need to be edited in the editor, then you'll need to add one of <a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/GameplayArchitecture/Properties/Specifiers/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">these tags</a> to the UPROPERTY depending on what exact behaviour you require.)</p>
<p>In your Door1 constructor, you need to actually create the scene component:</p>
<p>Door1.cpp</p>
<pre><code>ADoor1::ADoor1() {
    // Create the component
    DoorComp = CreateDefaultSubobject&lt;UDoorSceneComponent&gt;(TEXT(&quot;Door Component));
    // Attach it to the root
    DoorComp-&gt;SetupAttachment(RootComponent);

<p>Once you've done this and recompiled, the component will be attached in any blueprints/instances of your actor.</p>

<p>as you can see, i have tried to get a refrence to the door class but i dont know how can i execute the OnInteract function from here.. I realy tried looking this up on google and didnt really found something. I use manjaro linux as the operating system.
Im also new to Unreal Engine so please take it easy :) thanks</p>
<p>edit: I added some debug messages and added a bool named test in the door class (set to true by default) then in the Interact function in the character class i added an if statement if(Door1Cast-&gt;test) that if its true ill get a screen debug message and i runed the code and i did get the debug message. I think that if i can get a refrence to the DoorSceneComponent in the Door1 class. Any ideas how?</p>

<p>At first everything was going well. Until I realised that the perforce depot didn't had the same files as my workspace (I discorvered it after a sync that erased one month of work...). The reason is that new files or modification in already synced files (blueprints in my case) are not detected automatically and thus not proposed in the UE or PV4 interface.</p>
<p>Even if I manually add those files as changed, it will show the correct diff but will still considered that it is not changed :
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/D9nlX.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">diff from UE5 showing that the new changes are not considered as changes</a>. I have to say that, sometime, I am working without being connected to the source control and I deactivated the read-only files as I am working alone.</p>
<p>So my question is : is there a way to automatically detect changes in the blue prints or new files in the workspace?</p>
<p>Globally, I installed Perforce expecting that it would work a bit like Git but on UE blueprint and design asset.</p>
<p><strong>What I did:</strong>
I made changes to a blue print, created a new blueprint and refreshed the change list from UE5 perforce plugin to see my changes. But the list was empty.</p>
<p><strong>What I was expecting:</strong>
I was expecting the new or modified files to be present in the change list.</p>
","<p>When you reconnect to the Perforce server, use the <code>reconcile</code> command.  (Do this <em>before</em> you sync!)</p>
<p>This is explained in more detail in <a href=""https://portal.perforce.com/s/article/3481"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://portal.perforce.com/s/article/3481</a>, but essentially boils down to running <code>p4 reconcile</code> at the command line (this is what I do since it's a single command and does everything automatically), or &quot;Reconcile offline changes...&quot; in P4V (this takes you through more of an interactive process).</p>
<p>&quot;Reconciling&quot; your changes puts all of the new/modified files into the &quot;opened&quot; state (kind of similar to git's &quot;staged&quot; state but not quite), and very importantly, allows commands like <code>p4 sync</code> and <code>p4 resolve</code> to handle the files correctly.</p>

<p>So far I was able to do that using the &quot;Modeling&quot; mode, but it only allows to cut holes using pre-defined shapes, so my understanding is I would need to first create a copy of my asset, then cut the hole, manually create a collision volume so the hole can be walked through, then add the door mesh to cover the hole. Is this really the simplest way to add a door?</p>
<p>In comparison, with BSP I could create a box, add another box and set it to be subtractive, and I quickly made a hole in a wall with proper collision volumes and ability to resize any of the two volumes at any time.</p>

<p>There's no true answer to your question, as it becomes a matter of what you're most comfortable with.</p>
<p>Unreal Engine is slowly moving to become the center of all your DCC needs — control Rig on the animation side, static mesh editing and mesh creation tools for modeling, geometry script for procedural work, etc.</p>
<p>The ideal solution is BSP because you can edit the mesh in the simplest way possible inside the Engine (because the mesh was already most likely simple). <a href=""https://unrealcommunity.wiki/revisions/616489e95229ed20458b09fe"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Epic deprecated that in UE5 and replaced it with the Mesh Editor Tools.</a></p>

<p>You can also use Geometry Script for this, but I don't think you'll find an easy solution now. You can change the collision shapes directly in your static mesh editor and change the model directly there, but depending on the complexity of the model, you'll regret it. Unreal Engine is still not a replacement for other DCC tools, even though Epic is moving in that direction.</p>
<p>I would use Blender/Maya/3DMax and make modular parts of the wall, with some parts with holes for doors. Or find a modular pack at sale in the Epic marketplace, for example, <a href=""https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/medieval-village-mega-pack"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/medieval-village-mega-pack</a></p>
<p>I have not checked all features in UE 5.2, so there might be something that helps you more.</p>

75852447,Calculate a transform matrix between two component spaces in UE5.1,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75852447/calculate-a-transform-matrix-between-two-component-spaces-in-ue5-1,0,1679895935,"c++, unreal-engine5","<p>I want to obtain a 4x4 transform matrix from the local space of an StaticMesh Actor to the local space of an (unrelated) StaticMeshComponent. This matrix will then be used in a custom HLSL compute shader to transform a position from the actor's space to the components.</p>
<p>I obtain the actor transform via <code>actor-&gt;GetActorTransform()</code> and the component transform via <code>component-&gt;GetComponentTransform()</code></p>
<p>I know I can get the matrix for a <code>FTransform</code> through <code>GetMatrixWithScale()</code> and <code>GetMatrixWithNoScale()</code> functions.
I am also aware of the <code>GetRelativeTransform()</code> and <code>GetRelativeTransformReversed()</code> functions</p>
<p>However, as far as I can tell none of these do what I want. In particular they break when objects have both non-uniform scaling and a rotation.</p>
<p>I have calculated what I believe is the correct matrix as following:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>FMatrix44d makeWorldToLocalTransformMatrix(const FTransform&amp; transform) {
    auto L2WTranslation = makeTranslationMatrix(transform.GetTranslation()).InverseFast(); // Inverted
    auto L2WRotation = transform.GetRotation().ToMatrix(); // NOT Inverted
    auto L2WScale = makeScaleMatrix(transform.GetScale3D()).InverseFast(); // Inverted
    return L2WScale * L2WRotation * L2WTranslation;
}


FMatrix44d makeLocalToWorldTransformMatrix(const FTransform&amp; transform) {

    auto L2WTranslation = makeTranslationMatrix(transform.GetTranslation()); // NOT Inverted
    auto L2WRotation = transform.GetRotation().ToMatrix().InverseFast(); // Inverted
    auto L2WScale = makeScaleMatrix(transform.GetScale3D()); // NOT Inverted
    return L2WTranslation * L2WRotation * L2WScale;
}

FMatrix44d getLocalToLocalTransformMatrix(const FTransform&amp; actor, const FTransform&amp; component) {
    auto actorTransformMatrix = makeLocalToWorldTransformMatrix(actor);
    auto componentTransformMatrix = makeWorldToLocalTransformMatrix(component);
    return componentTransformMatrix * actorTransformMatrix;
}
</code></pre>
<p>But I would rather use a built-in function as this solution is not particularly efficient.</p>
<p>In the shader the matrix is used like:</p>
<pre><code>float4x4 TransformMatrix = ...;
float4 PositionToTransform = float4(..., 1)
float4 result = mul(TransformMatrix, PositionToTransform);
</code></pre>
<p>It seems to me that either:</p>
<ol>
<li>There must be a built-in function that can achieve this</li>
<li>There is some other approach that I am unaware of for achieving the same thing</li>
</ol>
","<p>It turns out that the result of <code>GetMatrixWithScale()</code> was the transpose of what I was expecting</p>
<p>This means instead of:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>FMatrix44d getLocalToLocalTransformMatrix(const FTransform&amp; actor, const FTransform&amp; component) {
    auto actorTransformMatrix = actor.GetMatrixWithScale();
    auto componentTransformMatrix = component.GetMatrixWithScale().InverseFast();
    return componentTransformMatrix * actorTransformMatrix; // WRONG!
}
</code></pre>
<p>The correct function was</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>FMatrix44d getLocalToLocalTransformMatrix(const FTransform&amp; actor, const FTransform&amp; component) {
    auto actorTransformMatrix = actor.GetMatrixWithScale();
    auto componentTransformMatrix = component.GetMatrixWithScale().InverseFast();
    return (actorTransformMatrix * componentTransformMatrix).GetTransposed(); // Fixed
}
</code></pre>
<p>I'm unsure as to why this is the chosen behaviour, but looking elsewhere it seems that several places use <code>Vector * Matrix</code> as the preferred order for matrix multiplication.</p>

This probably won't involve the UE editor itself since it is really a visual studio compile error.</p>
","<p><code>BlueprintCallable</code> functions can have only some specific parameter types and return types: <code>UObjects</code> or <code>UStructs</code> marked <code>Blueprintable</code> (that includes almost any frequently used object type, such as <code>AActor</code> inheriting types, actor components, textures/materials/essentially anything else you can find the content browser), <code>bool</code>s, numbers in <code>float</code>/<code>int32</code>/<code>int64</code>, text in <code>FString</code>/<code>FText</code>/<code>FName</code>, arrays/sets/maps of the types mentioned above as well, some delegates.</p>
<p>Outside of that, no other types can be used, because the Blueprint system wouldn't know how to make/display pins for such a type in the graph. For example:</p>
<pre><code>UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable)
void DoSomething(bool* BoolPointer);

<p>You are free to use standard library types if they don't need to cross over to the Blueprint world. However, if you want to use a string in any Unreal specific code, it's best to use <code>FString</code>. You can convert an <code>std::string</code> to <code>FString</code> easily, please see <a href=""https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/convert-std-string-to-fstring/5065/20"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> Unreal forum post.</p>

It's all going well and I've managed to get decent-looking pitch roll and yaw without gimbal lock.</p>
<p>I have a HUD which displays a ProgressBar showing yaw rate. It basically shows the yaw rate &quot;requested&quot; by the InputAction. So for example, if I set a maximum Yaw of 10 degrees per second and I have a maximum rotation of 10 degrees per second, the ProgressBar displays 100%.</p>
<p>What I'd like to do, to give the sense of &quot;Mass&quot; is to gradually accelerate up to the requested Yaw rate. So I have a &quot;Current Yaw Rate&quot; progress bar and a &quot;Requested Yaw Rate&quot; bar.</p>
<p>I'm not certain how to implement this rotational acceleration. I have a feeling that in my Tick function I need to somehow use a Lerp function to gradually approach the requested rate, but everything I've tried so far results in either zero yaw rate or infinite acceleration!

For example <strong>RedCylinder</strong> and <strong>BlueBox</strong> are entities on the grid and <strong>GridCoordinates</strong> in my case is index of the cell in grid, assuming (0,0) is left bottom corner with X as up vector: <strong>BlueBox</strong> - (5,5), <strong>RedCylinder</strong> - (6,7)</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/jFxEQ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/jFxEQ.jpg"" alt=""Unreal"" /></a></p>
<p>However UnrealEngine have its own grid that represented by WorldCoordinates, assuming that (0,0) of <strong>MyGrid</strong> and (0,0) of <strong>WorldGrid</strong> are aligned and 1:100 scale - suddenly my <strong>RedCylinder</strong> <strong>GridCoord</strong>(6,7) will have <strong>WorldCoord</strong>(650, 750). Obviously this is because entity is in center of the cell.</p>
<p>It is definitely not a problem, but I wonder is there are standarts and best practices of working with 2 Grids with different scale to each other. Right now I see 2 approaches:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Put entity on cell CORNER/VERTEX, however it can be necessary in some cases to have entity in cell rather then point not only visualy - for example like Inventory system or Turn-based Unit, but mechanicly as well like collision check of the <strong>GridFloor</strong> to entity.</p>
</li>
<li><p>My current implementation shifts <strong>MyGrid</strong> by half-size, so (0,0) is not the cell CORNER/VERTEX but CENTER. with this approach <strong>RedCylinder.GridCoord</strong> = (6,7) is <strong>WorldCoord</strong> = (600,700). However now I need to do math to align both grids - add cell-half-size to grid location. I fear this can became very complicated very fast when grid is builded in all directions around (0,0), be angled, rotated, have differente then square shape etc.</p>

Once received, I add the data to a TArray (acting as a buffer), and then decode as much as I can to PCM. Once decoded I add the new samples to an audio source. I then repeat this with all MP3 frames in the data stream.</p>
<p>I've confirmed that the MP3 is being transmitted correctly, however, the converted PCM has gaps/noise at the beginning of chunks of MP3 frames that distort the audio during playback.</p>
<p>Attached Code:</p>
<p><a href=""https://gist.github.com/DeveloperHarris/c3bd30d6cc689f22ec9e8fc839c80655"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://gist.github.com/DeveloperHarris/c3bd30d6cc689f22ec9e8fc839c80655</a></p>
<p>The top audio in Audacity is a test MP3 comprised of a 100Hz sine wave received by the Unreal Engine client.
The bottom track is the converted PCM stream.</p>
<p>The noise/gaps seem to occur at the beginning of new chunks. My initial theory was that it's due to the byte reservoir system of MP3 (given that the gap is roughly 3 frames long every time), but I thought minimp3 is supposed to account for that? It's the same instance of mp3d between chunks.</p>

","<p>Coming from a comment I gave to the original question:</p>
<p>The &quot;Error List&quot; window in Visual Studio does not work well with Unreal, due to parsing issues of IntelliSense. The best way to see if an Unreal project builds seems to be to just build it and ignore IntelliSense alltogether. In this case, it is best to set the dropdown in the &quot;Error List&quot; window to &quot;Build&quot; instead of &quot;Build + IntelliSense&quot;, to filter out any errors that just come from IntelliSense.</p>
<p>I found to just ignore the &quot;Error List&quot; and just work with the &quot;Output&quot; window to be a good solution as well, but that's just preference.</p>

","<p>Pixel Streaming utilises WebRTC. The WebSocket connection is used to facilitate the WebRTC connection, in a process known as <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Signaling_and_video_calling"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Signalling</a>.</p>
<p>In this instance, WebRTC is being used to share the video &amp; audio from the streamer server (in this case, the Unreal Engine). The user inputs (e.g. mouse clicks) are being sent from the user to the streamer over a WebRTC data channel.</p>
<p>To see the data transfer, you need to use the specific WebRTC tools in the browser. To access this, use the below URLs depending on which browser you use:</p>
<ul>

I have a custom function on the Actor BP that takes a string and converts it to the corresponding ENUM value and sets the public variable on the Animation Blueprint to trigger the Blend. This all works perfectly when triggered via a UI Widget.</p>
<p>Now to the remote call. I have used the output log command line to permanently enable the WebServer. Then, using Postman to simulate an API call, I first start my PIE session, then I query my actors to get the proper spawned actor blueprint path.</p>
<p>Then I perform a remote call on the function on the actor blueprint, using the spawned instance of the actor blueprint to make sure I'm targeting the PIE version.</p>
<p>The function actually executes (I see the printString statements on my Unreal viewport).</p>
<p>However, despite printing all the debug messages at all the right times, the triggered animation does not play.</p>
<p>I should point out that I know the function works because I also have it wired up to a Widget with buttons that use the exact same function in the exact same way, getting the exact same debug text output, but triggering the animations.</p>
<p>When I call that very same function from the remote API call, and see the very same debug output, the animations do not trigger.</p>
<p>What am I missing here?</p>

I would prefer doing this in C++ instead of Blueprints, but I'm open to any ideas.</p>
<p>I am trying to take an audio file and create the data needed to make an audio waveform (sample image of audio waveform below).</p>

<pre><code>frame 0: audio level 0

frame 2: audio level 0
frame 3: audio level 2
frame 4: audio level 0

<p>I have been looking at resources to get this but they all involve plugins that already do this, but I need to create this feature myself and I don't know where to start. If anyone has any sources or tips to get started that would be much appreciated, thank you.</p>
","<p>These are the steps to generate a graphical waveform.</p>
<ol>
<li>Load a wave file (*.wav) into memory and parse the wave header in order to retrieve the format and the actual audio samples. I suggest using a library to do this. There are quite a few of them
( e.g <a href=""http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/</a> or <a href=""http://www.portaudio.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.portaudio.com/</a> )</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>the wave format will typically be either <strong>WAVE_FORMAT_PCM</strong>  or <strong>WAVE_FORMAT_IEEE_FLOAT</strong>. The former can either be encoded as 8 bit unsigned samples (range <strong>[0-255]</strong>) or 16 bit signed samples (range <strong>[-32768 to 32767]</strong> ).
The latter is 32-bit floating point values (range <strong>[-1 to 1]</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>While not necessary, I suggest that you convert  WAVE_FORMAT_PCM samples to floating point values (WAVE_FORMAT_IEEE_FLOAT) as that would allow easier processing later.</li>
</ol>
<p>The conversion could simply be done like this</p>
<pre><code> enum  BitDepth { BIT_8, BIT_16, BIT_32 };
  
  //BIT_8/BIT_16 are WAVE_FORMAT_PCM,  BIT_32 is WAVE_FORMAT_IEEE_FLOAT
  
  vector&lt;float&gt; * ConvertToFloat(const char *pSamples, int len, BitDepth bitDepth){

    const unsigned char cByteHalf =   128;
    const unsigned int  cShortMax = 32768;

    const short * pSigned16;       //16 bit
    const unsigned char * pUnsigned8;
    const float * pFloat32;
    vector&lt;float&gt; * pvConvertedSamples = new vector&lt;float&gt;(len);
    
    switch (bitDepth) {
            case BitDepth::BIT_8:   //unsigned byte
               pUnsigned8 = reinterpret_cast&lt;const unsigned char*&gt;(pSamples);
               for (int i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {
               pvConvertedSamples -&gt;at(i) = pUnsigned8[i] == cByteMax  ? 1.0f
                             : pUnsigned8[i] == cByteHalf ? 0.0f
                             : static_cast&lt;float&gt;(pUnsigned8[i] - cByteHalf)/cByteHalf;
               }
            break;
            case BitDepth::BIT_16://signed short
               pSigned16 = reinterpret_cast&lt;const short*&gt;(pSamples);
               for (int i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {
                   pvConvertedSamples -&gt;at(i) = static_cast&lt;float&gt;(pSigned16[i])/cShortMax;

            default:

<ol start=""3"">
<li><p>Before we start iterating through the samples, we need to know how many samples in total we have and how wide in pixels our generated waveform is going to be. This is important
because this will allow us to compute a <strong>samples per waveform line metrics</strong>. For instance, if our file consists of 96000 samples and our generated waveform is 800 pixels wide, then
96000 / 800 = 120 samples per waveform line(let's call this X), which means that we have to process 120 samples for every waveform line (1 pixel wide). In general, this metrics won't be an integer so you have to be decide
what to do in such a case. If X=120,5 we could decide to alternate between 120 and 121 samples for consecutive waveform lines (so X will vary between 120 and 121 samples). If we don't take this into consideration, we'll either
run out of samples before we draw the entire length of our waveform or draw the entire waveform before processing all the samples. This process can't be 100% accurate but you have to come up with a solution that's good enough for you.</p>
</li>
<li><p>For every waveform line (1 pixel wide), iterate through X samples, and find the peak values among both positive and negative samples (2 peak values for every waveform line). The heignt of this
waveform line is simply given as (waveform_height * postive_peak_value)/2 and (waveform_height * negative_peak_value)/2 respectively. This assumes that the samples are in [-1 +1] range (step #2).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that stereo files are interleaved, which means that a left channel sample is followed immediately by a right channel sample, followed by a left channel sample and so on.</p>

I can manually switch this enum value in the Anim Preview panel.</p>
<p>Now I wish to control this enum value from a bunch of buttons added to a User Widget. The widget is instantiated within the Level BP.</p>
<p>When I edit the onClick events on the buttons, I do not know how to get a reference to my enum variable (which I have exposed as Public in the Anim Blueprint's settings).</p>
<p>Essentially, each button is designed to change this variable to a unique value, which then should cause the appropriate animation to play within the Blend Pose.</p>
<p>How do I let the Widget have access to that variable? Or vice versa, how could I create a variable on the blueprint that can be used to set the Enum value on the Blend Pose?</p>
<p>Please note that I am using the visual blueprint editor, not C++ at this time.</p>
","<p>I am coming from a 100% C++ background, so I may have some options on my mind that are not entirely working in BP, but we'll get to that.</p>
<ol>
<li>I would not use the level blueprint at all for anything. Instead use your GameMode or GameState for spawning the UserWiget. The GameMode and GameState are accessible via the GetGameMode node. Keep in mind that in multiplayer scenarios, only the GameState is available to all while the GameMode can only be accessed by the host or dedicated server, but that is probably irrelevant for you.</li>
<li>After spawning the widget assign it to a public variable of its type, so you can get it from the outside.</li>
<li>In your actor (not animation blueprint) you can access the GameMode easily using the <a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/BlueprintAPI/Game/GetGameMode/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GetGameMode</a> node. You have to cast it to your specific GameMode to get to the variable of the widget. For the GameState use <a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/BlueprintAPI/Game/GetGameState/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GetGameState</a>.</li>
<li>Now you have multiple options to connect everything together. You could for example pass your actor to the UI and store it as a variable there. The UI can then simply call a custom function like &quot;SetAnimationState&quot; that you create on the actor for each button. Your actor can pass the enum value down to the animation blueprint. Using your skeletal meshes <a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/BlueprintAPI/Components/SkeletalMesh/GetAnimInstance/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GetAnimInstance</a> node.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is one simple way I can think of. You could also work with an <a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/event-dispatchers-in-unreal-engine/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">event dispatcher</a> that broadcasts whenever a button is pressed and your actor is subscribed to it to get notified.</p>
<p>I hope any of this helps.</p>

One would be a component (CubeBlockComponent) which would be a CollisionBox with a Mesh, so I would like to use a UBoxComponent and a UStaticMeshComponent.
Second would be an Actor (ModuleActor) combining several CubeBlockComponent.</p>
<p>I was able to get the desired behavior with an actor composed of several BoxComponent and StaticMeshComponent, but configurating them the same way each time I want to add one block is a pain, thus the need of a CubeBlockComponent.</p>
<p><strong>My problem is I can't figure out how to do it properly. What should I do ?</strong></p>

<pre><code>    UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite)
        UStaticMeshComponent* cubeStaticMesh;
    UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
        UBoxComponent* boxCollision;

<p>And created them with CreateDefaultSubobject in the constructor:</p>
<pre><code>    // Create box collision
    boxCollision = CreateDefaultSubobject&lt;UBoxComponent&gt;(TEXT(&quot;BoxCollision&quot;));
    boxCollision-&gt;SetBoxExtent(FVector(40.f, 40.f, 40.f));
    boxCollision-&gt;SetupAttachment(this);

    // Create Cube static mesh
    cubeStaticMesh = CreateDefaultSubobject&lt;UStaticMeshComponent&gt;(TEXT(&quot;CubeStaticMesh&quot;));
    cubeStaticMesh-&gt;SetupAttachment(boxCollision);
</code></pre>
<p>Then, back in UE5 editor, I can make a blueprint component (BpCubeBlockComponent) based on my class (CubeBlockComponent).
But this is bad as in BpCubeBlockComponent I can only modify cubeStaticMesh and boxCollision via &quot;Open selecttion in Propery Matrix&quot;. And also, when I combine several BpCubeBlockComponent in an actor, the meshes just stays at the origin.</p>
<p>I feel like I should just create a class inheriting UBoxComponent, and basically recreating all UStaticMeshComponent functionalities inside the class, which would be a pain...</p>

","<p>If you have the server root folder (the one with the <code>db.*</code> files), you may be able to start up P4D and just access the depot normally.  If you have a checkpoint file, you can use that to reconstruct the db.* files.</p>
<p>If all you have are the depot archives, you can unzip the files inside them (using regular old <code>gzip</code> or similar) to retrieve the original content.  E.g. if you have <code>file.fbx,d/1.1234.gz</code>, you can unzip that and you'll have the content of <code>file.fbx</code> as of change 1234.

To make it as efficient and memory optimal as I can, I've decided to use soft object pointers to Data Assets that are loaded in as the clues are collected.</p>
<p>I'm trying to convert my Clue Management System in C++ and have made a Primary Data Asset to easily change the clue data. In my Clue Item code I have an interface call for attempting to interact with the Clue:</p>
<pre><code>bool AClueBase::AttemptInteraction_Implementation(UInteractComponent* Interactor)
{
    UE_LOG(LogClue, Display, TEXT(&quot;Clue Interacting&quot;));

    return ClueManager-&gt;CollectClue(ClueDataAsset);

<p>This works fine, with the Clue Data Asset being a UPROPERTY:</p>
<p><code>UPROPERTY(BlueprintReadOnly, EditInstanceOnly) TSoftObjectPtr&lt;UPrimaryDataAsset_Clue&gt; ClueDataAsset;</code></p>
<p>The Function it is trying to call on the Clue Manager Subsystem is:</p>

    FAreaClues AreaClues;
    // If the Map has the Enum already, then we need to save a reference to the current value
    if(CollectedClues.Contains(Clue-&gt;GetClueLocation()))
    {
    // If the Map has the Enum already, then we need to save a reference to the current value
        AreaClues = CollectedClues[Clue-&gt;GetClueLocation()];
        
        UE_LOG(LogClue, Display, TEXT(&quot;Clue Location already in Map&quot;));

    UE_LOG(LogClue, Display, TEXT(&quot;Clue doesn't already exist in Map&quot;), *Clue-&gt;GetClueName());
    
    AreaClues.CollectedClues.Add(Clue, true);
    CollectedClues.Add(Clue-&gt;GetClueLocation(), AreaClues);

","<p>You shouldn't be trying to cast your controller to local player, and also you'd rather setup <code>MappingContext</code> in <code>BeginPlay()</code> rather than in <code>SetupInputComponent(...)</code>.

<p><strong>Here is what I have done so far:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Created a UE5 project (Film/Video &amp; Live Event) </li>
<li>Imported a metahuman (custom-made) into the project </li>
<li>Added required plugins to project (Live Link, ArKit, Apple-etc) </li>
<li>Connected Live Link mobile application to local network </li>
<li>Set the metahuman's animation controller to the Live Link feed </li>
<li>Calibrated the Live Link data within the Live Link application </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The problem I am having:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Parts of the face are not responding at all (ex. metahuman's right eyebrow does not respond to me lifting my left eyebrow). </li>
<li>The left corner of the mouth seems to be stuck (ex. when I try to open my mouth, all points respond except for the single point stays where it is). </li>
<li>The mapping/naming of facial components seems to be mirrored/off/labeled wrong (ex. if I was to wink my right eye this would result in my right eye closing and my right cheek pressing upward. On the metahuman, the left eye would blink and the right cheek would raise.) </li>
</ul>
<p>These issues are very frustrating as I can not seem to get past this basic calibration. I see online people using these same tools and getting results with the metahuman's facial movements that are really clean. Is there something I am missing? I know that after the metahuman has been calibrated, I will create sequences, am I supposed to be modifying these value there? I am not sure... I have commented on every video I can find and I have posted this question in the Unreal Discord (here) with basically no help.
Note: I don't need a full solution, I just need to be pointed in the right direction! Please let me know if there is anything I am missing in my setup or calibration workflow.</p>

    FHitResult CurrentHit;
    FActorSpawnParameters SpawnInfo;

            }
        }
    }

<p>Below is the code for my header file where I declare the array of actor classes:</p>
<pre><code>UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
TArray&lt;TSubclassOf&lt;class AActor&gt;&gt; Flora;
UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
TArray&lt;TSubclassOf&lt;class AActor&gt;&gt; Fauna;

<p>The specific error I'm getting is this:</p>
<pre><code>&quot;C++ no instance of overloaded function matches the argument list
            argument types are: (TSubclassOf&lt;AActor&gt;, FVector_NetQuantize, FVector, FActorSpawnParameters)

<p>I've tried adding &quot;::StaticClass()&quot; as well as using &quot;-&gt;StaticClass&quot; to no avail.</p>

75051237,How do i use parameters with constructors?,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75051237/how-do-i-use-parameters-with-constructors,-1,1673211387,"c++, unreal-engine5","<p>I am programming in ue5 and i was creating a spatial hash. i needed to have a declared cell size for the hash, and i decided to use the constructor</p>
<p>Here is a similar code</p>
<p><em>HSpatialHash.h</em></p>
<pre><code>UCLASS()
class xxx_API UHSpatialHash final : public UObject
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
public:
    explicit UHSpatialHash(const float PCellSize) {CellSize = PCellSize;}
}
</code></pre>
<p>Error message:</p>
<pre><code>error C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Documents\Unreal Projects\attrition\Source\project name\Private\HSpatialHash.h(18):
error C2338: static_assert failed: 'You have to define UHSpatialHash::UHSpatialHash() or UHSpatialHash::UHSpatialHash(const FObjectInitializer&amp;). 
This is required by UObject system to work correctly.'
</code></pre>
<p>I tried to add the FObjectInitializer parameter, but it didn't work. I tried to put in in the cpp file, nothing, i don't know what to do. Can you help me?</p>
","<p>If you inherit from UObject, you have to provide either a default constructor or the one with the <code>FObjectInitializer</code> parameter. You create the object using NewObject() which does some internal initialization logic for the object and you can't pass parameters to it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i decided to use the constructor</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Depending on what you want to do, you probably should change your decision.</p>
<p>Do you need it to be a <code>UObject</code> with reflection and editor visibility? Because then, it would be easier to just add an &quot;Initialize()&quot; method with the parameters you wanted to have in the constructor and call it after creation, like so:</p>
<pre><code>UCLASS()
class xxx_API UHSpatialHash final : public UObject
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
public:
    inline void Initialize(const float PCellSize) { CellSize = PCellSize; }
}
</code></pre>
<p>and for creation:</p>
<pre><code>UHSpatialHash* spatialHash = NewObject&lt;UHSpatialHash&gt;(this);
spatialHash-&gt;Initialize(cellSize);
</code></pre>
<p>If you only want it to be a simple class without reflection, you can just use a regular C++ class and use your custom constructor.</p>
<hr />
<p>Another option would be to use a <code>USTRUCT()</code> instead. It can't do as much as the <code>UCLASS()</code>, but since you do not intent to inherit from it, it may be enough. You can define a custom constructor and do not need to care for the <code>FObjectInitializer</code> parameter.</p>

<li>First mark your text as variable. Then literally [Get] it in ur bp.</li>
<li>Get a branch [set 'name'] from your text (I my case Head Txt).</li>
<li>Then from Set set a branch [SetText] and type ur text.</li>

<p>I tried to solve the problem many times without any results !!
Hope to help me.</p>
","<p>There are probably a few ways you can do this, but you can simplify this quite a bit. I also suspect you can do all of it in the animation blueprint.</p>
<ol>
<li>Simplify the first part (XDoMa.jpg) using the <code>Find Look At Rotation</code> node.</li>
<li>Break the output of this and create another rotator with the yaw from that node and the pitch and roll from the turret's world rotation (you're currently setting pitch and roll to zero in cDJ08.jpg, which you don't want to do in case the tank is on a slope).</li>
<li>To rotate the turret to point at the target, use the <code>RInterp To</code> node and connect its output rotator to a <code>Set World Rotation</code> node. The nice thing about the 'RInterp To' node is that you can set the speed. For a bit more realism you could use some simple maths to accelerate and decelerate the turret's rotation.</li>
<li>Another thing you'll want is a bool variable in the tank actor BP. Then you can use a branch in the animation BP to trigger the stuff above when you set the bool to true.</li>
</ol>
<p>The key parts to this are the <code>Find Look At Rotation</code> and <code>RInterp To</code> nodes, and to do all of it in the animation BP.</p>

<p>Level layout:
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/GIXsn.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">level layout</a></p>
<p>What NPC behavior I want to achieve:</p>
<ol>
<li>NPC can freely walk around Area #1</li>
<li>NPC isn't allowed to go to Area #4 in general but it may decide to go there in some exceptional cases</li>
<li>If NPC wants to interact with the player he has to go to Area #2 and check if player is in Area #3. If player is not there, NPC have to wait until player enters Area #3</li>
</ol>
<p>I know that I can affect the path NPC chooses by using navigation modifier volumes and changing navigation cost in some areas.</p>
<p>But, based on goals above, I also need at least the following</p>
<ol>
<li>I need to get random point within specific area (for goals #1 and #3)</li>
<li>I need to check if some actor is in specific area (for goal #3)</li>
</ol>
<p>And I guess I don't really need &quot;navigation cost&quot; feature, since if I could get random point in <strong>specific</strong> area, I would be able to control where NPC goes anyway</p>
<p>The questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>What actor should I use to mark some areas as &quot;NPC can go here if they want to walk around&quot;, &quot;NPC can go here if they want to interact with player&quot;, etc?</li>
<li>If volume is the best option, what volume should I use? My concerns about Navigation Modifier volume is that I don't really need to modify navigation process by blocking it completely or adjusting its cost.</li>
</ul>
","<p>I have used the <strong>NavMeshBoundsVolume</strong> to define the area that my AI character is allowed to be in.</p>
<p>Then I used <strong>blackboards</strong> and set points the AI could walk around too, adding variables enabling or disabling a point. In your case you could have a variable that is true when the player is in area #3.

<p>I can't really make sense on what you are trying to do from the screenshot, all I can say is that your variable (either just the variable or the whole Character) is not initialized.</p>
<p>But for sure, if you are trying to implement a double jump as the variable name suggest, then quit that Youtube tutorial because it is absolutly not the way of doing it.

Just know your problem might solve itself. Sit back, grab some popcorn, watch a movie, take a break. You need it.</p>

","<p>This is because after the player hits the box collision, Unreal will restart the level so fast that you will not be able to hear the sound, in order to fix this problem just add a delay node after the play sound 2d node to hear the audio, then use the open level node afterwards.</p>

73234605,Unreal Engine 5 Server,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73234605/unreal-engine-5-server,1,1659610217,"server, game-engine, unreal-engine5","<p>I want to create multiplayer-only card game, where I'm hosting the servers and have full control over whats going on (Database, Game, Players, Accounts)</p>
<p>So client is basically just to log-in and display cards in right spots</p>
<p>As I have 0 any game engine, but I'm a backend developer - I can see doing server by myself (It's not hard card game) and managing everything</p>
<p>Buut I can't figure out good solution for communication</p>
<p>All I saw is TCP/IP plugins (<a href=""https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/tcp-ip-socket-server-and-client?sessionInvalidated=true"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">one paid</a>, <a href=""https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/tcp-socket-plugin"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">one free</a>, idk the differences)</p>
<p>But are there any good solutions for something like that?
Unreal documentation shows their own networking API but it's mainly for FPS/ RPG games where sync and effects is needed and this is exacly what i <strong>don't</strong> want - only simple commands from server where server says ex. &quot;Now cards are in this spot&quot; &quot;Game over&quot; &quot;Player 1 used Growl!&quot; and client just display this changes</p>
","<p>For Unreal Engine itself, you don't need any kind of plugins, as Unreal take care by itself of the networking using <strong>Replication</strong> <a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/property-replication-in-unreal-engine/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Replication doc for UE5</a></p>
<p>What the Replication does is exactly what you need (replicating states across client and server) for game itself, but is a bit different than what you are looking for, as you pointed out.</p>
<p>In any native multiplayer architecture for Unreal, you'll have the server <strong>emulate the game</strong> and &quot;playing&quot; it on it's own, then tell the client what's going on with Replication (the object will be a cloned state of what is on the server, with server authority). It is a simplified explication and <strong>you'll find all the informations about replication on UE Forum or Documentation like <a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/programming-network-multiplayer-games-for-unreal-engine/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and <a href=""https://cedric-neukirchen.net/Downloads/Compendium/UE4_Network_Compendium_by_Cedric_eXi_Neukirchen.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">there</a></strong>.</p>
<p>What you are describing does looks a lot like external API server (like used for backend web in any kind of sort) and <em>can</em> be use on Unreal, but it is a nightmare. The reason why is it's because you need to <strong>do aaaaaaaall the replication code yourself</strong> : ask the server for action, wait for answer, mitigate wrong data or network, handle all the fallback case, then implement all again on the server every logic you want to make multiplayer. And I will not even talk about the fact that server will have a very hard time to deal with the Unreal scene itself.</p>
<p>For more context on API-kind networking, you can look into older MMO game like <em>TERA</em> which was coded this way. It often involve developing your own network stack to plug in Unreal and so on.</p>
<p>I'm myself a backend developper but now specialized in Unreal Engine, and I can see the reason why you want to follow that API way. But it is <strong>very expansive</strong> and if you are discovering UE or want to start on, <strong>I strongely recommand you to use the native replication instead</strong>. It is already hard enough with it.</p>
<p>If you still really want to do it the API way, than you just have to integrate a TCP/UDP packet forger into Unreal (code it yourself I mean, or take a plugin that do it) than do all the dirty stuff to forge and forward the packet to your custom API server that you have to create on side (Nod.js stuff or whatever). It will work, but you will have absolutly no automatisation of any kind on Unreal end.</p>

IDatasmithMeshElement
IDatasmithMeshActorElement</p>

<p>Any help please?</p>
","<p>I've just understood what is meant by &quot;the pivot point must be baked into the mesh&quot;. I've took all the points of the AutoCAD geometries and created meshes out of them as they are. But the mesh itself must be builded around the point where I want the pivot point to be (relative to the mesh).</p>
<p>So I think the correct way to do this is to translate all the points of the ACAD geometry so that the center point (where I want the pivot to be) is 0,0,0.
Then I build the mesh around it and translate the mesh actor, that holds the instance of the mesh, to the position in the scene where the mesh should be.</p>
<p>Edit: That was exactly the solution...just in case anyone else has the same problem.</p>

To do this I am using the <code>GetTangentData()</code> method which belongs to the <code>FStaticMeshVertexBuffer</code> class (<a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/API/Runtime/Engine/Rendering/FStaticMeshVertexBuffer/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link</a>).</p>
<p>The <code>GetTangentData()</code> method is defined two ways in the docs (<a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/API/Runtime/Engine/Rendering/FStaticMeshVertexBuffer/GetTangentData/1/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link1</a>, <a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.27/en-US/API/Runtime/Engine/Rendering/FStaticMeshVertexBuffer/GetTangentData/2/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link2</a>):</p>

<p><strong>Q1</strong>. What is the reason to have a void pointer return type?</p>
<p><strong>Q2</strong>. How can one access the data from such a return?</p>
","<p><strong>Q1.</strong> What is the reason to have a void pointer return type?</p>
<p>A <code>void*</code> is a pointer to something, but that something is not known. Thus, there is a degree of flexibility to <code>void*</code>, resulting in the ability to be cast into many types of pointers. For example, <code>malloc</code> has a return type of <code>void*</code> because it's supposed to be used to allocate memory for all types of pointers. In C++, we can code function overloads because templates exist, so <code>void*</code> is more of a C thing. It is used in C++ to maintain backwards compatibility with C for libraries that are designed for usage with both C++ and C.</p>
<p><strong>Q2.</strong> How can one access the data from such a return?</p>
<p>You typecast it:</p>
<pre><code>void* void_ptr = func_that_returns_void_ptr();
char* char_ptr_typecast = (char*) void_ptr;
std::cout &lt;&lt; char_ptr_typecast &lt;&lt; '\n';

","<p>The way to do dynamic casting in Unreal Engine is just to simply call the <a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/API/Runtime/CoreUObject/Templates/Cast/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Cast</a> function. In case you're curious, that function returns <code>TCastImpl&lt;From, To&gt;::DoCast(Src)</code>, and the <code>DoCast</code> function is implemented as follows as of UE 5.0,</p>
<pre><code>// This is the cast flags implementation
FORCEINLINE static To* DoCast( UObject* Src )
{
    return Src &amp;&amp; Src-&gt;GetClass()-&gt;HasAnyCastFlag(TCastFlags&lt;To&gt;::Value) ? (To*)Src : nullptr;
}
</code></pre>
<p>In UE 4.25 and below, before using cast flags, <code>DoCast</code> would call <code>IsA</code> instead to determine whether a pointer could be safely casted. Now it just uses bitwise operations between the source and destination object types' cast flags to see if the cast can be done.</p>
<p>Quick example: Assuming I had a custom <code>AActor</code> class called <code>AWizard</code> and a variable of type <code>AActor*</code> called <code>SomeActor</code>, may or may not be a wizard actor.</p>
<pre><code>if (AWizard* Wizard= Cast&lt;AWizard&gt;(SomeActor)) {
    // Cast succeeded
}
else {

<p>For example, if I want a defined C++ macro <code>MY_BUILDTIME_VAR</code> to be <code>0</code> in certain builds, and <code>1</code> in others, without having to modify source code every time, in a similar approach to environment varibles in many tools (i.e. <code>NODE_ENV</code> in <code>node.js</code>), or to the  command-line approach of i.e. <code>g++</code> (see <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11783281/solution-wide-defines-in-visual-studio"">here</a>).</p>
<p>I am aware it's possible to define target-wide macros in a project's <code>target.cs</code> with <code>GlobalDefintions.Add(&quot;MY_TARGET_VAR=0&quot;)</code> or module-wide macros in a module's <code>Build.cs</code> with <code>PublicDefinitions.Add(&quot;MY_MODULE_VAR=0&quot;)</code>. It helps to have all things defined in one place, but those definitions are still baked in the source file, and can't be changed at build time.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/SharingAndReleasing/Deployment/BuildOperations/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">official documentation</a> mentions several ways of building/cooking an Unreal project with custom parameters, such as the <code>Project Launcher</code> tool and the <code>RunUAT</code> script file. Do any of them allow for build-time macro definitions?</p>
<p>Note: I am not using MS Visual Studio, but JetBrains Rider with <code>.uproject</code> only, so I can't define them in an <code>.sln</code> solution file.</p>
","<p>Use an environment variable and read it in your build.cs file. Based on the environment variable set the value of your macro.</p>
<p>This is a handy utility method I use for this purpose:</p>
<pre><code>private void AddEnvironmentVariableDefinition(string variableName, string defName, string defaultValue = &quot;0&quot;)
{
    string value = System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(variableName) ?? defaultValue;
    PublicDefinitions.Add(String.Format(&quot;{0}={1}&quot;, defName, value));

Everything works fine. The player can pick items up and drop them, as well as cycle them between hand and pocket, as long as 'Simulate Physics' is set to false on the item that is being picked up. Anything the player interacts with that has 'Simulate Physics' enabled falls through the floor upon interaction. <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/Z5DHx.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this is the physics settings of the object</a></p>
<p>I need the code to allow me to pick up physics items. I believe that the 'Set Actor Enable Collision' is the issue as when this is not in the loop the Actor does not fall through the ground, however I need to disable the Actors collision with the player otherwise movement is hindered. I don't understand why the 'Attach Actor To Component' doesn't hold the Actor in place when the Actor 'Simulate Physics' is set to true.</p>

<p>A few precisions :</p>
<p>I managed to get my hands on my old UE4 project and tried to use my new library in the old project, still getting the same error.
I also have an other UE5 project (UE5 native, no migration) using this library, that works perfectly and doesn’t crash. I still need to figure out how to fix the migrated UE4 project because the demo is way more advanced on that one, and we need to use it to show the features and characteristics of our library to potential clients.
The line 59 in SFSPlugin.cpp mentionned in the crash report is just “IMPLEMENT_MODULE(FSFSPluginModule, SFSPlugin)”
When trying to build the project from source code manually, the build runs without any problem and appears to be successful.
I tried to figure out what this exception code means, but the crash report is very unclear to me. I’ve attached the detailed report to this post, if you can help me figure out what that crash means it’d be great.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance !</p>

","<p>I don't have access to the Unreal Engine source code and I don't know if Epic has done anything highly unconventional.</p>
<p>From your start menu launch the &quot;Developer Command Prompt for VS2022&quot;. This is a shortcut file for launching the Windows command line with a batch file run to set up the PATH and other environment variables for the Visual Studio development tools.</p>

<p>Solution files (.sln) are a completely different format but MSBuild can build a solution file.</p>
<p>From the screenshot in the question I can see that the solution is UE5 which will be UE5.sln. I can also see that you want to build a C++ project. I'm guessing the project may be named BenchmarkTest (BenchmarkTest.vcxproj)?</p>
<p>MSBuild has a notion of targets. A target always has a name and it groups a set of tasks to be performed. (It's like a makefile rule in some respects but it's not the same.)</p>
<p>Solutions and projects created with Visual Studio support some standard targets. The 'Build', 'Rebuild', and 'Clean' menu items map directly to some of these targets.</p>
<p>Visual Studio solutions and projects support Configurations and Platforms. The standard Configurations are <code>Debug</code> and <code>Release</code>. The screenshot shows a non-standard configuration of <code>Develop</code>. The screenshot also shows a platform of <code>Win64</code>.</p>
<p>In the Developer Command Prompt, msbuild should be in the PATH. Try the following command:</p>
<pre><code>msbuild --version
</code></pre>
<p>To build the solution with the default target (which is 'build') and the default configuration and platform:</p>
<pre><code>msbuild UE5.sln
</code></pre>
<p>To run a 'clean':</p>
<pre><code>msbuild UE5.sln -target:clean
</code></pre>
<p>The target switch can be shortened to <code>-t</code>.</p>
<p>The configuration and platform are passed as properties using the <code>-property</code> switch. The short form is <code>-p</code>. Multiple property switches can be provided and multiple properties, delimited by ';', can be provided in one property switch.</p>

</code></pre>
<p>The &quot;must&quot; part doesn't sound very serious to me: Visual Studio seems to be 8GB and I'm not even sure whether it's free.</p>
<p>Is there a way to use C++ in UE5, without installing Visual Studio?</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong>
as also proposed in some comments, there is a guide to setup VS Code: <a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/setting-up-visual-studio-code-for-unreal-engine/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/setting-up-visual-studio-code-for-unreal-engine/</a>.
However, the problem with that guide is that: &quot;<em>This guide assumes that you have installed Unreal Engine and created a C++ project with it.</em>&quot;, but you can't create a project without Visual Studio, because the create button is disabled.</p>
","<p>A C++ project for Unreal engine can be created manually, since it's defined exclusively in text files arranged in a specific directory structure in the file system.</p>
<p>Firstly, you need the project file itself. It is a json file with <code>.uproject</code> extension (let's call it <code>MyProject</code> for example). The contents required are a <code>EngineAssociation</code> field for the engine version (which can be both be intalled from Epic Games Launcher or built from source), and at least one module in the <code>Modules</code> array. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>{
    &quot;FileVersion&quot;: 3,
    &quot;EngineAssociation&quot;: &quot;4.27&quot;,
    &quot;Category&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
    &quot;Description&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
    &quot;Modules&quot;: [
        {
            &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;MyProjectModule&quot;,
            &quot;Type&quot;: &quot;Runtime&quot;,
            &quot;LoadingPhase&quot;: &quot;Default&quot;,
            &quot;AdditionalDependencies&quot;: [
                &quot;CoreUObject&quot;,
                &quot;UMG&quot;,
                &quot;Engine&quot;
            ]
        }
    ]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we need to create target files. Create a <code>Source</code> folder in the same directory as the <code>uproject</code>. In that folder, two files are needed: one for the standalone project and one for the in-Editor project. They are named <code>(ProjectName).target.cs</code> and <code>(ProjectName)Editor.target.cs</code> (note: no space or underscore before <code>Editor</code>, i.e. <code>MyProject.target.cs</code> and <code>MyProjectEditor.target.cs</code>).</p>
<p>These files are used to set up overall build settings. Contents can be nearly identical. In their simplest form, here is <code>.target.cs</code>:</p>
<pre><code>using UnrealBuildTool;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class MyProjectTarget : TargetRules
{
    public MyProjectTarget( TargetInfo Target) : base(Target)
    {
        Type = TargetType.Game;
        DefaultBuildSettings = BuildSettingsVersion.V2;
    }
}

</code></pre>
<p>and <code>Editor.target.cs</code>:</p>
<pre><code>using UnrealBuildTool;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public class MyProjectEditorTarget : TargetRules
{
    public MyProjectEditorTarget( TargetInfo Target) : base(Target)
    {
        Type = TargetType.Editor;
        DefaultBuildSettings = BuildSettingsVersion.V2;
    }
}

</code></pre>
<p>Finally, you need to define the <code>MyProjectModule</code> module that was declared in the <code>uproject</code>. Make and a subfolder named after the module in the <code>Source</code> folder (for this example, <code>Source/MyProjectModule</code>). There, three files are needed: a <code>build.cs</code> which defines how to build this module, a <code>ModuleName.h</code> and <code>ModuleName.cpp</code> files that &quot;implement&quot; the module for Unreal's reflection system.</p>
<p>Simplest <code>Build.cs</code>:</p>
<pre><code>using UnrealBuildTool;


public class MyProjectModule : ModuleRules
{
    public MyProjectModule(ReadOnlyTargetRules Target) : base(Target)
    {
        PCHUsage = PCHUsageMode.UseExplicitOrSharedPCHs;
            
        PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { 
            &quot;Core&quot;, 
            &quot;CoreUObject&quot;, 
            &quot;Engine&quot;
        });
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Simplest module <code>.h</code>:</p>
<pre><code>#pragma once

#include &quot;CoreMinimal.h&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Simplest module <code>.cpp</code>:</p>
<pre><code>// Copyright Epic Games, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

#include &quot;MyProjectModule.h&quot;
#include &quot;Modules/ModuleManager.h&quot;

IMPLEMENT_PRIMARY_GAME_MODULE( FDefaultGameModuleImpl, MyProjectModule, &quot;MyProjectModule&quot; );
</code></pre>
<p>This should be a sufficient base project to follow the rest of the official guide for using VS Code / other IDE. That doesn't answer the part of your question about using <code>g++</code> for compilation, and will require either <code>MSVC</code> on Windows or <code>Clang</code> on Linux and Mac. I hope that's not a big issue.</p>

<p>I can't seem to find a node that will allow me to mix these different channels together.</p>

","<p>I don't have Unreal available at the moment, so I can't give you a screenshot, but I try to describe it.</p>
<p>Instead of multiplying the color, you could just use a <code>Linear Interpolate</code> node to combine them one by one.</p>
<p>You plug the result of <code>Mask(R)</code> into a <code>Linear Interpolate</code> node as its <code>Alpha</code>. You then plug the color you want the <code>R</code> channel to be into <code>B</code>. You then create the next <code>Linear Interpolate</code> node and plug <code>Mask(G)</code> into <code>Alpha</code> and the result of the first <code>Linear Interpolate</code> into <code>A</code>, the color you want the <code>G</code> channel to be into <code>B</code>. Proceed with the next node until everything is covered.</p>
<p>How does this work?</p>
<p>Linear Interpolate uses <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">linear interpolation</a> to map the values between <code>0</code> and <code>1</code> to whatever you plug into A and B. You can think of the Linear Interpolate node as a filter for a mask. If you want to combine two shapes onto another, you plug your mask-input into <code>Alpha</code> and everything in <code>B</code> will be seen instead of <code>A</code> when the mask is <code>1</code>. You can read more about this in <a href=""https://joyrok.com/SDFs-Part-Two"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a>. You will find a lot of essentials under &quot;Math Signed Distance Fields - COMBINE, BLEND, AND MASK SHAPES&quot;.</p>

I want to replicate the blueprint way in c++. However, I'm not able to set the absolute rotation of a springarm component with a attached camera. From the cpp code I created a blueprint and compiled everything successfully. However, changing the rotation doesn't.</p>
<p>What my code looks like:</p>
<pre><code>#include &quot;Hero_Paper_Character.h&quot;

#include &quot;Camera/CameraComponent.h&quot;
#include &quot;GameFramework/SpringArmComponent.h&quot;

    SpringArmComponent-&gt;SetWorldRotation(FRotator(0.0f, -90.0f, 0.0f));
    SpringArmComponent-&gt;TargetArmLength = 550.f;
    SpringArmComponent-&gt;bEnableCameraLag = true;
    SpringArmComponent-&gt;CameraLagSpeed = 4.f;

    CameraComponent = CreateDefaultSubobject&lt;UCameraComponent&gt;(TEXT(&quot;Camera&quot;));
    CameraComponent-&gt;SetupAttachment(SpringArmComponent);

}

<p>I also tried out to set different stuff unfortunately without any success:</p>
<pre><code>    SpringArmComponent-&gt;SetUsingAbsoluteRotation(true);
    SpringArmComponent-&gt;AddWorldRotation(FRotator(0.0f, -90.0f, 0.0f));
</code></pre>
<p>It just doesn't change anything and nothing is happening.

I mean, there're are tutorials on how this macro works, but these are just use cases.</p>
<p>How does the compiler know that <code>UPROPERTY()</code> references the variable under it?</p>
<p>example:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
int x = 0;
</code></pre>
<p>I know that unreal is open source, but its codebase is huge.</p>
","<p><code>UPROPERTY</code> is not a real C++ macro. It looks like one, so the compiler accepts it, but it actually is used by the <a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/ProductionPipelines/BuildTools/UnrealHeaderTool/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Unreal Header Tool</a> (UHT) to create code that will then be added in the <code>GENERATED_BODY</code> code of your class. The UHT is a parser that just takes all of your code and searches for all those <code>UCLASS</code>, <code>UPROPERTY</code>, <code>UFUNCTION</code>, etc. declarations and then generates the proper code for it that will then be put in the &quot;XXX.generated.h&quot; and &quot;XXX.generated.cpp&quot; files that you include. For example, if you want your variable to be readable via blueprints, a getter logic is created to allow the blueprint logic to call it.</p>
<p>So the compiler does not actually know anything about what a <code>UPROPERTY</code> is, because the pre processor removes it entirely due to it not having an actual body.</p>
<p>If you want to know how the UHT works in depth, you should look <a href=""https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/tree/release/Engine/Source/Programs/UnrealHeaderTool"" rel=""noreferrer"">into its code</a>. There you could also modify it to suit your needs, including custom code generation.</p>
<hr />
<p>A side note regarding macros in Unreal: The Slate framework in Unreal actually uses macros to generate a lot of boilerplate code without the Unreal Header Tool. Maybe looking into it will give you some insights. But they are not identical to the power of the code generation done by the UHT.</p>

<p>But if I switch to 2D noise it works perfectly fine.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/xT3qz.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">2D Noise result</a></p>
","<p>This answer applies to Perlin like noise.</p>
<p>Your integer chunk size is dis-contiguous in noise space.</p>
<p>'Position'  needs to be scaled by <code>1/Height</code>. To scale the noise as a contiguous block.  Then scale by <code>Height</code>.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you were happy with the XY axes(2D), you could limit the scaling to the Z axis:</p>
<pre><code>FastNoiseLiteObj-&gt;GetNoise(Position.X, Position.Y, Position.Z / Height) * Height;    
</code></pre>
<p>This adjustment provides a noise continuous Z block location with respect to Position(X,Y).</p>
<h2>Edit in response to comments</h2>
<p>Contiguous:
The noise algorithm guarantees continuous output in all dimensions.</p>
<p>By sampling every 32 pixels (dis-contiguous sampling), The continuity is broken, on purpose(?) and augmented by the Density.</p>
<p>To guarantee a top level grass layer:</p>
<p><code>Densities.Add(Noise + (ChunkPosition.Z &gt; Threshold) ? 1: 0);</code>
Your code<code>- ChunkPosition.Z</code> made grass thicker as it went down. Add it back if you wish.</p>
<p>To add random overhangs/underhangs reduce the Density threshold randomly:
<code>if (Density &lt; (rnd() &lt; 0.125)? 0.5 : 1)</code>
I leave the definition of <code>rnd()</code> to your preferred random distribution.</p>
<p>To almost always have overhangs, requires forward lookup of the next and previous blocks' Z in noise.</p>
<p>Precalculate the noise values for the next line into alternating arrays 2 wider than the width to support the edges set at 0.</p>
<p>The algorithm is:</p>
<pre><code>// declare  arrays: currentnoise[ChunkSize + 2] and nextnoise[ChunkSize +2] and alpha=.2; //see text
    for (int y = 0; y &lt; ChunkSize; y++) // note the reorder y-z-x
    {
        // pre load currentnoise for z=0
        currentnoise[0] = 0;
        currentnoise[ChunkSize+1] = 0;
        for (int x = 0; x &lt; ChunkSize; x++)
        {
             currentnoise[x + 1] = GetNoise(FVector(ChunkPosition.X + x, ChunkPosition.Y + y, ChunkPosition.Z));
        }
        for (int z = 1; z &lt; ChunkSize -2; z++)
        {
            nextnoise[0] = 0;

            {
                nextnoise[x + 1] = GetNoise(FVector(ChunkPosition.X + x, ChunkPosition.Y + y, ChunkPosition.Z + z+1));
            }

        {

70222487,How do you reset an Unreal Engine 4/5 landscape back to 0 Z height or sea level?,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70222487/how-do-you-reset-an-unreal-engine-4-5-landscape-back-to-0-z-height-or-sea-level,0,1638583416,"unreal-engine4, unreal-engine5","<p>Changing the Z on the location of the landscape does not change the actual landscape height location.</p>
<p>Here are some examples to explain.</p>
<p>New landscape is at sea level 0
You can see this by looking at the blueprint actor Z height which when zero intersects the landscape plane.  A positive Z height on the blueprint actor moves it above and a minus for below.  This is working as expected.  The problem is when I import a certain heightmap the landscape is not at 0 even if I change the Z location to 0 for the landscape.  Again you can see the actual height location of the imported landscape by seeing the location of the blueprint actor.</p>
<p>New blank landscape demonstrating what the Z height the landscape should be at, look at the Z height of the blueprint actor.  This shows that the landscape is actually at zero.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/yOknG.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/yOknG.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>When I move the blueprint actor up the Z height goes up as expected.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/0CN5s.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/0CN5s.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>Now the problem is on this next picture showing the imported landscape.  In this picture you can see that the blueprint actor is at -24550.0.  This is the true height level of the landscape which should be 0.  Note in the next picture you can see that the landscape Z height is already set at 0
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/PnEZ9.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/PnEZ9.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>Picture showing landscape Z is already at 0 even though this is not the true landscape height.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/VBsuU.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/VBsuU.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>So my question is how do you reset the landscape to be back at 0 height sea level even though the Z height is showing 0?  Without changing any of the landscape features.  I will need to be able to change the landscape Z scale which should only affect the sculpted features however it does seem to move the landscape.  I don't really understand that.</p>
","<p>A 16 bit height map has a range of -32768 to 32,768, so the &quot;height&quot; is determined in your height map file.  If exporting from something like World Machine then add a constant value to the heightmap before exporting.</p>

","<p>The issue here is actually pretty straight forward: in Blueprints when you 'Find' a member of Map you are not getting it by-reference, instead you get the copy.</p>
<p>This is exactly what happens at the end of your nested loop: You get a copy, you add item to it, and when another iteration kicks-in the copy gets terminated.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/lgDEk.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/lgDEk.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>And here on my side it returns exactly the same result as expected:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/hNPCm.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/hNPCm.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>The fix for that would be easy:</p>
<p>After editing a Copy, you can overwrite the Map member by its copy (via 'Add' node).</p>
<p>But in your case it will be more tricky. You cannot just plug the same BreakStruct/Array node that you just used because it would call whole Find sequence again which creates another copy. Look</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/XrbRv.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/XrbRv.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>If you are confused. This code actually looks like this for Unreal's point of view.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/t1DTE.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/t1DTE.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>So you have to store the the Struct in local variable first, then perform any operations on it and after everything is done - overwrite the Map member by its locally stored copy. And the result is</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/ypqHD.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/ypqHD.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>Map member gets overwritten every time and everything is as it should be.</p>
<p>Well, almost... For some reason your code is stored in Macro. I think you have to change it to a Function to be able to create local struct variable. But it shouldn't be a problem in this specific case because in your code there is no logic that needs to be done in macro.</p>
<p>Hope, it helps</p>

<p>There are some conflicts in there -- e.g. Unity's <code>.ini</code> files want to be <code>binary</code> whereas Unreal's <code>.ini</code> want to be <code>text</code>.  As you suggest, though, that's easily resolved by just scoping the two sections of the typemap to different depots.  Assuming you have two depots called &quot;unity&quot; and &quot;unreal&quot; you'd just do:</p>

The players have 2 options, Create a session or join a session which is triggered with 2 buttons in the menu (Host and Join).

Once he selects map and enter number of players against which he wants to play, he clicks host button which will open level (in Ip Address) containing the server map which is a lobby. In the lobby gamemode, I have condition which will check if the lobby has n number of players that the host player has input in the menu before and then will load the level that the host player has selected in the menu before. The only problem which is frustrating me right now is the fact that I am not able to pass those menu variables to the server map (lobby) gamemode.

(coordinates[x,y,z], TimeDelta, Speed, Brake)
Any documentation is very much appreciated</p>
","<p>There is no existing functionality in the engine itself for this extremely specific use case. Of course, it can &quot;support&quot; it if you write a custom solution using the many available tools within the engine.</p>
<p>You can use <code>IFileHandle</code> to stream in a file (your csv): <a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/API/Runtime/Core/GenericPlatform/IFileHandle/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link</a></p>
<p>You can then parse the incoming data to create a <code>FVector3</code> of your coordinates, a <code>float</code> of your TimeDelta, etc. For example, <code>FVector::InitFromString</code> may help: <a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/API/Runtime/Core/Math/FVector/InitFromString/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link</a></p>
<p>However, this depends very much on the format of your data. Parsing string/texts into values is not specific to UE4, you can find a lot of info on converting streams of binary/character data to needed values.</p>
<p>Applying the animation as the data is read is a separate, quite big, task. Since you provide no details on what the animation data represents, or what you need to apply it to, I cannot really help.</p>
<p>In general though, it can help you a lot to break down your question into 3-4 separate, more specific, questions. In any case though, this is a task that will require a lot of research and work.</p>
<p>And even before that, it might be good to research alternative approaches and changing the pipeline, to avoid using such non-standard file structures for animation.</p>

But, when defining your own custom events, macros, or functions in Blueprint, you can use spaces in the name and it does not appear that the engine automatically adds spaces to a camel-cased name (e.g. <code>MySuperAwesomeMacro</code> appears as <code>MySuperAwesomeMacro</code> in the graph).</p>
<p>Is it all right to use spaces? Should they be avoided? I could swear I read in a guide somewhere to avoid spaces but I can't seem to find anything on it right now.</p>

","<p>There are a few things to consider here.</p>
<p>You can imagine blueprints as something the engine turns into C++ when you are done. But since you are never going (nor will be able to) read that code, the engine can name the functions anything it wants. So it doesn't really care what you call them as it has a map internally mapping <code>Check if this ball can bounce?</code> to <code>FUNC_ABZ</code> or something like that.</p>
<p>This is why you can do many strange things like starting functions with numbers, adding special characters, having spaces and more.</p>
<p>If you consider this then it is actually a lot of power. Like anything else with programming languages with great power comes great responsibility. The fact that you can do this is a pretty great step towards being able to give meaningful names to stuff - BUT - it comes with a cost. Your own standardization and consistency is extremely important.</p>
<p>In my opinion and how I develop (similar to concepts when you write code)  I try to give functions names with actions and verbs and variables are more nouns or explanations of what they hold. I use this feature of blueprints to the fullest. (so a C++ <code>isStarted</code> boolean would definitely be <code>has the great event started ?</code> in blueprints)</p>

<p>The mouse keeps escaping the full-screen whenever I either jump, move, rotate the camera or keep spinning to the left. But only on the left side of the screen, not the right, not the middle, not beneath, only on the left side.

<li><p>Changed both the software and hardware cursors. But the cursor is unchanged. So it's not the game's cursor that appears in-game. It's the actual windows cursor.</p>

<li><p>I tested every option in the Default Viewport Mouse Lock Mode.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Deleted both Saved and the Intermediate folders.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Someone told me it has something to do with how the mouse is locked (or not) on viewport. And that, that might be the reason behind the cursor leaving escaping full-screen.</p>
<p>I don't have two monitors. The game is in full-screen. The issue persists in windowed mode as well. No widgets.</p>
<p>Tested it in packaging and in a Standalone game. (Issue persisted.)</p>
<p>The issue happens only if I click the left mouse button. If I play the game without clicking it, the cursor does not appear in-game.</p>
<p>Update:</p>
<p>It appears like going to the game's exe's compatibility and changing the high DPI settings' scaling behavior to application fixes the problem but reduces the fps. This is a temporary fix but I need a permanent one.</p>

<p>EDIT:
In UE5, you need to change NMake's <em>IncludeSearchPath</em> instead of <em>VC++ Directories</em> in Properties -&gt; NMake</p>
","<p>You need to add an include path to the &quot;Game&quot; folder.</p>
<p>To set an include path you now must right-click a project and go to:</p>
<pre><code>Properties -&gt; VC++ Directories -&gt; General -&gt; Include Directories
</code></pre>
<p>Then add the include directory like so:</p>
<pre><code>C:/foobar/Game
</code></pre>
<p>First try using an absolute path. And if that works you will want to use a <a href=""https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/reference/common-macros-for-build-commands-and-properties?view=msvc-170"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Macro</a>. Macros allow users to define paths without being specific to their own computer (So other people can use it).</p>
<p>Perhaps what you need is <code>$(ProjectDir)</code> but I can't tell since I don't know where &quot;Game&quot; is relative to your project files.</p>
<p>But as an example:</p>
<pre><code>$(ProjectDir)/Game
</code></pre>
<p>It's worth pointing out that what you are doing is interacting with the compiler option <code>/I</code> on the <code>MSVC compiler</code>. Visual Studio is just a gui abstracting it away for you.</p>

<p>When I look at the Visual Studio debugger it shows the assertion error:</p>
<pre><code>Array index out of bounds: 65533 from an array of size 5
</code></pre>
<p>But when I look at the Locals window that array index (stored in <code>CurrentStatus.State.Index</code>) has a value of<code>2</code>, not <code>65533</code>. How can this be?</p>
<p>The relevant source code is:</p>
<pre><code>    for (FStateTreeHandle Handle = CurrentStatus.State; Handle.IsValid(); Handle = StateTree-&gt;States[Handle.Index].Parent)
    {
        const FBakedStateTreeState&amp; State = StateTree-&gt;States[Handle.Index];

<p>The assertion is hit the first time through the for loop when calling <code>StateTree-&gt;States[Handle.Index]</code>, so <code>Handle.Index</code> is getting the value <code>CurrentStatus.State.Index</code> (which is <code>2</code>).</p>

","<p>Turns out the comments on the question gave me the right clue here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The bottom line is that you cannot simply debug optimized code, and expect the debugger to adjust itself to the optimizations done by the compiler.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I debugged using a non-optimized build of UE5, I quickly saw the issue, and the <code>CurrentStatus.State.Index</code> is in fact <code>65533</code>.</p>
<p>In case others run into this, it's not enough to use the &quot;DebugGame Editor&quot; config in the Visual Studio project for your game. That config only compiles your game's code without optimizations, the engine is still run using optimized code.</p>
<p>To run the engine without optimized code, you need to <a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/building-unreal-engine-from-source/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">build it from source</a> and use the &quot;Debug Editor&quot; Visual Studio config to disable optimizations.

<p>A Blueprint Callable function that takes <code>UPARAM(ref) bool&amp;</code> as a parameter which can but doesn't have to be passed inside of Blueprint Graph (variable doesn't have to be plugged into input pin to this node for the graph to compile). And by *asing on if the parameter has been passed or not, the function will behave in a slightly different way.</p>
<p>For example, I was able to create something like this in C++ (<a href=""https://pastebin.com/gfbXKVVw"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pastebin</a> <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/2Qs98.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">imgur</a>):</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>void Func(bool&amp; param = *(bool*)0)
{
    if (&amp;param == nullptr)
        // do something
}
</code></pre>
<p>Above code compiles and consistently behaves in VS2022, allows to call <code>Func()</code> without passing any parameters in it and execute code basing on if the parameter has been passed which is the exact behavior that I'm looking for.</p>
<p>However, this code is a C++ undefined behaviour not allowed for UFUNCTIONs. So, when I try to declare something similar as BlueprintCallable UFUNCTION in Unreal, this of course will not compile:</p>
<pre class=""lang-cpp prettyprint-override""><code>UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable)
static void Func(UPARAM(ref) bool&amp; param = *(bool*)nullptr);
</code></pre>
<p>due to error:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>C++ Default parameter not parsed: param &quot;(bool)nullptr&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So my question is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the &quot;behaviour/functionality&quot; that I want to achieve even possible in BlueprintCallable functions?</li>
<li>Is there any workaround to what I've described above? For example in form of macros, custom data containers or function specifiers?</li>
</ul>
<p>I think summary of my question might be a little bit misleading. I just want to recreate this type of code/behaviour <a href=""https://pastebin.com/gfbXKVVw"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">pastebin</a> <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/2Qs98.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">imgur</a> in Unreal's 'UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable)'. Yes, I understand that given example is an UB, but this is the closest result to what I want to create. This is just an example.</p>
<p>This question is Unreal Engine / UFUNCTION related. This is not a typical C++ issue. Unreal uses macros for <code>UFUNCTION</code> declaration and compiles in a different way than regular C++ (<a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/4.26/en-US/ProgrammingAndScripting/GameplayArchitecture/Functions/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UFunctions</a>). Because of that pointer cannot be used as parameter in this case as Unreal does not allow it. However pointer would be an actual solution to this question if it were only about pure C++.</p>
<p>Possible but not exact solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>meta = AutoCreateRefTerm( &quot;param&quot; )</code> can be specified in the UFUNCTION declaration. This allows Blueprint Node to have default value in pass-by-ref pin. However, with this approach another condition (bool pin) is needed because it is not possible check if actual variable gets passed or not.</li>
<li>In comments <a href=""https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/API/Runtime/Core/Misc/TOptional/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TOptional</a> has been mentioned. This data container is actually something that exactly fits here, but TOptional cannot be used as parameter in BlueprintCallable UFUNCTION due to <em>&quot;Error: Unrecognized type 'TOptional' - type must be a UCLASS, USTRUCT, UENUM, or global delegate.&quot;</em>, or at least I don't know how to use it.</li>
</ul>
<p>My question has been closed as a dupe of <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4364536/is-null-reference-possible"">Is null reference possible?</a> which isn't true. My question asks for high level functionality in Unreal's Blueprints/UFUNCTIONS that would omit the need of &quot;null reference&quot;.

<p>Thats nothing you should worry about (if gives you an error just connect it with the world context variable).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But basicly, every function that comes from a function library (not from an actor), needs to have a reference in the world to be executed. That’s why it appears, when you call a function from a class that comes from the the class actor it will assume that the world context is the actor itself, that’s why it not appears in characters and actors, it still there but it just not visible.</p>

Will describe the code first:</p>
<p>I have my ArtToolsUI class inheriting from QMainWindow. In this class I set some basic stuff like groupboxes, layouts etc.:</p>
<pre><code>class ArtToolsUI(QMainWindow):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.setAttribute(Qt.WA_DeleteOnClose, True)
        self._app = self._get_qt_app()
        self.resize(600,400)
        self.editor_tools_buttons = [] #for showcase this has no widgets in it
        self._main_widget = self._set_layouts()


    def _get_qt_app(self):
        qt_app = QApplication.instance()
        qt_app.setQuitOnLastWindowClosed(True)
        return qt_app


    def get_v_layout(widgets):
        widgets = make_list(widgets)
        layout = QVBoxLayout()
        layout.setObjectName(&quot;vert_layout&quot;)
        for widget in widgets:
            layout.addWidget(widget)
    
        return layout

    
    def _set_layouts(self):
        default_grpbox_names = {&quot;tools&quot;:self.editor_tools_buttons}
        all_grp_boxes = []
                
        for key in default_grpbox_names:
            layout = get_v_layout(default_grpbox_names[key]) # right now this just returns empty QVBoxLayout
            new_grp_box = QGroupBox(title=key)
            new_grp_box.setAttribute(Qt.WA_DeleteOnClose, True)
            new_grp_box.setLayout(layout)
            all_grp_boxes.append(new_grp_box)
        
        main_layout = get_v_layout(all_grp_boxes)

        main_widget = QWidget()
        main_widget.setObjectName(&quot;tat_main_widget&quot;)
        main_widget.setLayout(main_layout)
        self.setCentralWidget(main_widget)
        
        return main_widget
</code></pre>
<p>I also implemented function for removing all widgets in this unreal python session. This method is called from different module.</p>
<pre><code>def _remove_widgets():
    qt_app = QApplication.instance()
    
    if qt_app != None:
        all_qt_widgets = qt_app.allWidgets()
    
        for widget in all_qt_widgets:
            widget.setParent(None)
            widget.close()
            widget.deleteLater()
            
</code></pre>
<p>This _remove_widgets() method goes through all existing widgets, which should be destroyed, but for some reason only my ArtToolsUI main window is getting destroyed and all other widgets are still hanging around in the memory.
On the other side when I manually click on the X button to close the window it closes everything.</p>
<p>Does anyone know what might be the problem?</p>
","<p>Ok I think I figured it out.</p>
<p>When running PySide6 on unreal you actualy cannot start your own QT event loop ( if you do, Unreal Editor will freeze and wait till you end your window). QT somehow finds unreal GUI event loop, which is responsible for everything .. except answering deleteLater().</p>
<p>Only two ways ( I found) for deleting UI are:</p>
<ol>
<li>When user clicks on X button to end the Window -&gt; This automatically ends and removes all widgets in that window.</li>
<li>When calling <code>QApplication.closeAllWindows()</code> -&gt; This calls all windows, but definitelly better than if they stay in memory.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both ways seem to bypass <code>deleteLater()</code> functionality, as documentation for <code>deleteLater()</code> <a href=""https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/qobject.html#deleteLater"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">says</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The object will be deleted when control returns to the event loop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the end I ended up with this functionality:</p>
<ol>
<li>I am not deleting dialogs, I just hide them on <code>close()</code>.</li>
<li>Then when creating them I ask if there are dialogs with my specific object name (object name is class property at every window I have)</li>
</ol>
<p>This will prevent spawning multiple widgets ( 10k widgets is aprox. 1.2GB RAM)</p>
<p>ADD: There is also possibility to use <code>self.setAttribute(Qt.WA_DeleteOnClose, True)</code> on closing. This will delete dialog from memory as well.</p>

72962436,BTService not updating a Blackboard Key,https://stackoverflow.com/questions/72962436/btservice-not-updating-a-blackboard-key,1,1657697301,"c++, unreal-engine5","<p>I am trying to create a system for AI enemies in my game so that they &quot;retreat&quot; when they are low on health. In order to accomplish this, I created a BTService that actively gets the Health of a character and saves it in a Blackboard Key.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have noticed that the service is able to set the &quot;Health&quot; value correctly once, but doesn't appear to update it ever again. As such, the Blackboard Key constantly remains at a certain value even if the enemies' health decreases.</p>
<p>What essentially happens is:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>There is a ShooterCharacter class with a Health variable.</li>
<li>In its Behavior Tree, there is a Blackboard Key also called &quot;Health&quot; that will store the value of Health in the ShooterCharacter class.</li>
<li>To achieve this, a BTService was made called &quot;Update Character Health.&quot;</li>
<li>At the start of the game, Update Character Health works as intended. In the Behavior Tree, the Health key value is shown to be 70, the Health ShooterCharacter classes start off with.</li>
<li>However, it stops working afterward. The key remains at 70 even if the health of the ShooterCharacter class it belongs to has its health reduced to 40.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is the code for the Update Character Health BTService.</p>

    {
        return;
    }

    OwnerComp.GetBlackboardComponent()-&gt;SetValueAsFloat(GetSelectedBlackboardKey(), Character-&gt;Health);
};
</code></pre>
<p>An odd thing I noticed is that the issue with this might have something to deal with the <code> OwnerComp.GetBlackboardComponent()-&gt;SetValueAsFloat(GetSelectedBlackboardKey(), Character-&gt;Health);</code></p>
<p>I inserted the following ULOG after the <code>AShooterCharacter*  Character = Cast&lt;AShooterCharacter&gt;(OwnerComp.GetAIOwner()-&gt;GetPawn());</code> command.</p>
<pre><code>    UE_LOG(LogTemp, Warning, TEXT(&quot;Character Health: %f&quot;), Character-&gt;Health);
</code></pre>
<p>Oddly enough, this ULOG is able to keep up. If the Character's Health is at 40, it prints out 40. Despite this, the Blackboard Key remains at 70 even with this ULOG active.</p>
<p>I understand if this is somewhat loaded/confusing, I am also kind of stumped by this problem so feel free to ask me anything else.</p>

the AFS...apk gets installed on my device without an issue, but not the case for the other .apk file.
However when launching the installed AFS...apk app it's stuck on the splash screen forever.</p>
<p>I also get this warning at the start:

Is there perhaps something to change in the APL_armv7 ? because in Agora.Build.cs: I uncommented this line: string Architecture = &quot;arm64-v8a&quot;; to support the arm64 architecture</p>

<p>If I put in the console r.SetRes 1920x1080, then the game goes fullscreen (for a 1080p screen). But end-users can't access console.</p>
<p>What do I do to make it go fullscreen?</p>
","<p>The problem lies within window's screen settings (tested on windows 10 &amp; 11).</p>
<p>One option in window is called &quot;resolution scaling&quot;. When this is not 100%, then the game will not cover the screen (if scale &gt; 100) or zoom too much in the game (if scale &lt; 100).</p>
<p>In UE, there's an option to automatically ajust the game to window's scale setting.
It's the &quot;Allow High DPI in Game Mode&quot; in the project settings (under Engine - User Interface). Check that to true and problem solved.</p>

<p>Is this doable with UE4/UE5? If not, which game engine should I be looking into?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
","<p>This task requires two separate things: importing mesh data from a file, and displaying the mesh data.</p>
<p>For importing mesh data, it's possible to use the open-source cross-platform 3D file import library, <a href=""https://github.com/assimp/assimp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">assimp</a>. You need to compile it for needed platform (the documentation of the library is good, it describes how you can do that in detail). Then you need to include the binaries/includes in the engine: help for that <a href=""https://unreal.blog/how-to-include-any-third-party-library"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> (and elsewhere on the internet, just search &quot;include third-party library in Unreal).</p>
<p>Assimp can import many file types, and give you arrays of vertex positions, UVs, normals, as well as triangle data. This data then needs to be displayed.</p>
<p>For displaying mesh data, you can use Procedural Mesh Component which is included in the engine, or a free open-source alternative, which has several improvements: <a href=""https://github.com/TriAxis-Games/RuntimeMeshComponent"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Runtime Mesh Component</a>.</p>
<p>Those components have functions such as <code>CreateMeshSection</code>, which have as input parameters those same arrays of vertices/uvs/etc.</p>
<p>Specifics of the implementation depend on your needs. Documentation of these libraries will help.</p>

However, I have come across multiple learning resources suggesting that scaling a normal map is a good way to increase &quot;bumpiness&quot; of a surface.</p>
<p>I would expect the correct approach to be scaling up the bump map, and then generating a new normal map (with normalized vectors). Multiplying normals should not give the same result.</p>
<p>Additionally, I was looking at Unreal's &quot;FlattenNormal&quot; material function. This function lerps between a normal and (0, 0, 1). This clearly does not always result in a normalized vector. This suggests to me that either:</p>
<ol>
<li>the magnitude of a normal vector does in fact matter;</li>
<li>or normal vectors get normalized before being used.</li>
</ol>
<p>If 2. is the case, then scaling up normal vectors by a scalar should not achieve anything, right?</p>

I have a powerful RTX 3090, and I want to utilize it as much as possible.</p>
<p>Can UE4/5 effectively leverage GPU resources to render video? If not, is there a better engine to effectively leverage GPUs for rendering?</p>
","<p>UnrealEngine provides a very advanced cinematic tools,including movie render queue module which allows rendering the UE view-port to image sequence or video (very limited number of formats). However, UE doesn't encode video on GPU in that specific case. I write &quot;that specific&quot; for a reason. UE does use Nvidia GPU encoder(if available) for fast and efficient encoding to H264 when Pixel Streamer feature is used to stream video with WebRTC. But this one is for interactive streaming of the engine,not for video encoding. So even though you can deploy UE in a remote render farm and try to encode a massive amount of video data, it won't be as fast as using dedicated hardware encoder, such as NVIDIA NVENC. Moreover, UE doesn't provide video encoding to H264 at all. You would have to encode into JPG/PNG/BMP image sequence,then use tool like FFMPEG to convert to video. I recently put on GitHub an <a href=""https://github.com/sasmaster/MP4ExporterUE4"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MP4 encoder plugin</a> for UnrealEngine, which I wrote for my needs, but this one uses also CPU to perform encoding.</p>

","<p>You should use a reasonable delay, enough to save the file, between your calls.</p>
<p>Do not use a for loop, as it's resulting in a blocking call of too many operations.</p>
<p>Here is something that should work:</p>

<p>Call &quot;start&quot; once, then &quot;take next&quot; once. &quot;Take next&quot; is recursive, so after this, you just need to wait for needed time, until all images are made.</p>
<p>You might also consider using a &quot;file exists&quot; node, to check if the sccreenshot you're about to make already was made, and skip if it was. That way, even if you crash in the middle, you won't need to re-make all screenshots.</p>

For that I have this following code:</p>
<pre><code>void ACollidingPawnSpawnPawns::DelayedFunction() {
         // The first parameter 'SphereComponent' is the main component in the level and it has been created using the CreateDefaultSubobject method in the constructor of this class.  But that method can't be used outside the constructor.
         USphereComponent *dynamicallyCreatedSphere = NewObject&lt;USphereComponent&gt;(SphereComponent, USphereComponent::StaticClass());

             dynamicallyCreatedSphere -&gt;SetVisibility(true);
 }
</code></pre>
<p>After I run the level I don't see this dynamic sphere pop up.</p>
<p>For the main 'SphereComponent' that does show up this code is in the constructor:</p>
<pre><code>// Our root component will be a sphere that reacts to physics
 SphereComponent = CreateDefaultSubobject&lt;USphereComponent&gt;(TEXT(&quot;RootComponent&quot;));
 RootComponent = SphereComponent;
 SphereComponent-&gt;InitSphereRadius(40.0f);
 SphereComponent-&gt;SetCollisionProfileName(TEXT(&quot;Pawn&quot;));
 
    // Create and position a mesh component so we can see where our sphere is
     UStaticMeshComponent* SphereVisual = CreateDefaultSubobject&lt;UStaticMeshComponent&gt;(TEXT(&quot;VisualRepresentation&quot;));
     SphereVisual-&gt;SetupAttachment(RootComponent);
     static ConstructorHelpers::FObjectFinder&lt;UStaticMesh&gt; SphereVisualAsset(TEXT(&quot;/Game/StarterContent/Shapes/Shape_Sphere.Shape_Sphere&quot;));

     }
</code></pre>
<p>But again I can't use the CreateDefaultSubobject to create the UStaticMeshComponent outside the constructor.</p>
<p>So I imagine for me to see my dynamicallyCreatedSphere in my level I would have to create a UStaticMeshComponentand I would need some variation of the FObjectFinder method to invoke (this FObjectFinder also doesn't work outside the constructor).</p>
<p>I've been stuck on this for a while now. Anyone know how to do this?</p>
<p><strong>Update 2021-12-2</strong>
Thanks to advice from <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/70180682/4722577"">https://stackoverflow.com/a/70180682/4722577</a> below, here's the final code I have to create the sphere dynamically:</p>
<p>In the cpp file:</p>
<pre><code>void ACollidingPawnSpawnPawns::spawnPawns()
{
    if (dynamicallyCreatedSphere == nullptr) {
        //dynamicallyCreatedSphere = NewObject&lt;USphereComponent&gt;(USphereComponent::StaticClass()); // compiles
        dynamicallyCreatedSphere = NewObject&lt;USphereComponent&gt;(SphereComponent, USphereComponent::StaticClass());
        //dynamicallyCreatedSphere-&gt;SetupAttachment(SphereComponent);
        dynamicallyCreatedSphere-&gt;InitSphereRadius(30.0f);
        dynamicallyCreatedSphere-&gt;SetCollisionProfileName(TEXT(&quot;Pawn&quot;));
        dynamicallyCreatedSphere-&gt;SetRelativeLocation(FVector(155.0f, 165.0f, 45.0f));
        dynamicallyCreatedSphere-&gt;SetVisibility(true);


        dynamicMesh = NewObject&lt;UStaticMeshComponent&gt;(this);
        dynamicMesh-&gt;AttachToComponent(dynamicallyCreatedSphere, FAttachmentTransformRules::KeepWorldTransform);
        dynamicMesh-&gt;RegisterComponent();
        dynamicMesh-&gt;SetStaticMesh(StaticMesh);
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>in the .h file I have these 3 lines:</p>
<pre><code>UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)
UStaticMesh* StaticMesh;

USphereComponent* dynamicallyCreatedSphere = nullptr;
UStaticMeshComponent* dynamicMesh = nullptr;
</code></pre>
<p>Declaring the StaticMesh as a UProperty allows me to select the mesh manually in the UE interface.  Then when I run the level that StaticMesh is inserted into the dynamicMesh variable.</p>
","<p>First, only <code>NewObject</code> can be used to create components outside of constructor:</p>
<pre><code>void ACollidingPawnSpawnPawns::DelayedFunction() 
{
    // you should specify outer as current actor (because this component is part of it)
    USphereComponent* DynamicallyCreatedSphere = NewObject&lt;USphereComponent&gt;(this, USphereComponent::StaticClass());
    DynamicallyCreatedSphere-&gt;RegisterComponent();
    // when component is dynamically created, you can use AttachToComponent, not SetupAttachment
    DynamicallyCreatedSphere-&gt;AttachToComponent(GetRootComponent(), FAttachmentTransformRules::KeepRelativeTransform);
    DynamicallyCreatedSphere-&gt;InitSphereRadius(30.0f);
    DynamicallyCreatedSphere-&gt;SetCollisionProfileName(TEXT(&quot;Pawn&quot;));
    DynamicallyCreatedSphere-&gt;SetRelativeLocation(FVector(155.0f, 165.0f, 45.0f));
    DynamicallyCreatedSphere-&gt;SetVisibility(true);
}
</code></pre>
<p>Instead of <code>FObjectFinder</code> you can use <code>LoadObject</code> to load something using specified path. But I think this is incovinent way, because ref is hardcoded.
Use following code in UCLASS instead:</p>
<pre><code>UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere) 
UStaticMesh* StaticMesh;
</code></pre>
<p>And specify static mesh directly: <code>SphereVisual-&gt;SetStaticMesh(StaticMesh);</code></p>
<p>After that you can inherit C++ class to blueprint and pick StaticMesh from Content Browser.</p>

(Checking the address of the scrapPart and the this in the Tick function is the same.) One additional very interesting behaviour is that in the scope of the overlap function after the modification of the CurrentTarget property, UE_LOG showed an updated value, but the value on the scrapPart's tick function stayed the same.</strong></p>
<p>This is unreal engine 5.</p>
<p>Have anyone encountered something like this?</p>
<p>EDIT: Added the logging parts and also here is the output from the log:</p>

","<p>I found out the problem, in my case I use Rider from Jetbrains as IDE, and when I asked to install the <strong>RiderLink plugin</strong> I installed it in the Engine, and not in the project, and as it is still in early access, Rider is also having some bugs and when I install this plugin in the Engine, it returns these errors.</p>

<p>Since I'm using an AZERTY keyboard I'm trying to change the control of UE to fit my needs, I had no problems re-binding the viewport camera controls, but once I click &quot;Play&quot;, the camera actor is only responding to WASD controls, and I cannot find a way to switch it to ZQSD.</p>
<p>The project I'm on is a simple blank Game template, so there is no actual PC when I click play, it's just a camera that I'm trying to control to move around my world.
As suggested in several other posts, I tried going to Edit &gt; Project settings &gt; Engine &gt; Inputs &gt; Axis Mappings and creating a MoveForward mapping for Z with 1.0 scale (and for S with -1.0 scale, on my second attempt) but nothing is doing the trick...</p>

<p>I also notice that by default a 10.6 Gb project on UE4 (unpackaged) will be only 7.1 Gb with UE5.</p>
<p>The goal is to be able to transfer easily the project between an EXT4 external drive (linux) and Windows OS and also share the project online. 10 Gb on github is a bit... too much...</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for a solution</p>
<p>NB: I tag it UE4 since UE5 is really recent and also most of the knowledge related to UE4 may apply to the UE5 solution</p>
